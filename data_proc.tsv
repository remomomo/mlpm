9	considerably effective	the antibiotic may have destroyed bacteria causing my sinus infection.  but it may also have been caused by a virus, so its hard to say.
9	highly effective	lamictal stabilized my serious mood swings. one minute i was clawing up the walls in pure mania, the next curled up in a fetal position on my bed contemplating suicide  i am no longer at the whim of my moods and neither are those around me. im lucky that i started pharmaceuticals almost immediately after i was diagnosed a bipolar. lamictal gives me amazing clarity to go about my day, honestly assess myself and form real relationships. lifted a fog, i guess you could call it. now that im medicated i realize how cloudy my thought processes used to be. it's a wonderful feeling.interestingly, i hardly dreamt before beginning lamictal. i would dream (i mean dream in the sense of being able to imagine pictures and scenes while asleep, not rem) maybe once every two months. now i dream every night. i found that the closer i take it to bedtime the more frequent and more intense my dreams.
4	moderately effective	initial benefits were comparable to the brand name version of this drug, depakote.  i had been taking depakote for several months and experienced great results.  when i went to my psychiatrist for an evaluation and re-fill, he accidently prescribed the generic version,   when i discovered the error, i was told by this doctor that i would experience the same results as depakote.  the positive side effects of the depakene: balanced mood, improved concentration, improved logical cognition, mental clarity, lessened anxiety and irritability, improved sleep, increase in pleasure about activities
10	highly effective	it controls my mood swings. it helps me think before i act or speak. it controls anxiety  it freed me to live my life happily!!! i cared about my life more. everything had more meaning to me. i lived a very dull life before taking prozac.
10	highly effective	within one week of treatment superficial acne lesions were visibly reduced.  sebum production which had been excessive before beginning was significantly reduced (after course of treatment level increased to a more normal level).  after one month of treatment no new acne lesions occured.  by the end of treatment no new acne developed, and old lesions had healed.
2	marginally effective	by the end of the 10-day treatment i felt better, but still had major congestion, green/yellow mucus and was coughing up mucus.  the symptoms were milder than before i started the treatment but definitely not gone.
8	considerably effective	reduction in seizures reduction in seizures reduction in seizures didnt have lots of seizures how many times can i say the same thing im sorry but there's not a whole lot to say here i keep repeating the same stuff over and over again to get to fifty words.
10	highly effective	ive been taking tramadol for 2 weeks now. ive been taking vicodin and for 7 months due to cervical disk degeneration and lower back pain. i have to admit i loved taking vicodin and  the problem is that they would knock me out. tramadol has been awesome. it takes 90% of the pain away and i feel like i actually have energy again. from reading previous comments it sounds like i take a lower dose. im really happy about that cause if i get use to it then i can up my dose and not feel worried about it.
10	highly effective	"i immediately stopped having panic attacks.  it really was miraculous, as they were becoming more and more frequent and severe.  on the combination of klonopin and prozac, i have not experienced a panic attack in 10 years. i simply feel ""normal"", and am able to go through my days without any feelings of extreme nausea or dizziness, which is how my panic attacks manifested themselves.  no longer did i have to leave work early, avoid restaurants and supermarkets, or worry about getting suddenly ""sick"", for no reason."
1	marginally effective	the presumed benefits were to help with a severe depression. in the beginning there was some benefit, ie less suicidal, apathetic, morbid, depressed. but the effects were short lived and dose had to be continually increased. the biggest benefit was probably placebo - feeling like i was getting help, hopeful and trusting in the treatment and doctors.
3	moderately effective	some pain relief recieved minimized pain when touched
9	highly effective	significantly diminished the symptoms and size of the cold sore.  often, it would halt the development and the redness and swelling would disappear after a day or two, without the sore blistering/weeping/scabbing.  for my body, valtrex has proven to be far more effective than either famvir, or    it is surprising how many people either do not treat cold sores, or are not aware of any new treatments after zovirax.
6	moderately effective	treatment benefits were noticeable but not substantial. i did not respond to a day as i or the doctor had hoped. but it did allow me to stay focused throughout the day with out drowsiness or fatigue, so i give it a positive review. treatment effectiveness varies among individuals
10	highly effective	very quick migraine relief with no nausea or drowsiness. other medications (such as imitrex and  had little to no effect, or took a minimum of 1 to 2 hours for relief to begin. i really like the dissolving tablet, as i can take it anytime without having to find a water fountain or other beverage. relief is very quick, generally within 20 to 30 minutes.
5	moderately effective	the xanax would act as a downer. it would calm me temporarily but could throw me into depression depending on the situation. if the situation was mildly traumatic the xanax would calm me but then follow by depression. the following day i would have residual sedation. the main complain was the addiction. it was not exactly like a craving but if you did not take it your body would feel like something was missing. it did not hurt but until i took it again i felt not quite content and as soon as i would take the pill my body would feel like it would give a sigh of relief. i think it is as much addiction to the mind as to the body.
5	moderately effective	the benefits were to eventually stop smoking.
7	moderately effective	to reduce acid production and stop acid reflux, the tablets are easy to swallow and moderately effective, their effectivity is diminished if reflux is already occuring.

9	considerably effective	helped build bone loss. osteoporosis runs in my family. we are thin. two of my sisters were diagnosed with osteoporosis in their early 40s. one sister fractured her pelvic bone at 40 from bone loss.
9	considerably effective	blood sugar controlled levels around 100-110, blood pressure had been normal ever since i was placed on these b/p medications.xanax was the only one that could prevent anxiety and panic attacks and help me sleep. as for fosamax, i have not had a follow up bone density so i do not know how beneficial it is for treating osteoporosis
5	highly effective	i have suffered of rapid heart rate for sometime because of my thyroid problem. i was given this medicine to get my heart rate controlled. first few weeks the medicine did not seem to work for me but my doctor increased the dosage to twice a day, then that was the time i started to feel my heart rate slow down. the medicine is definitely effective but i guess the effect of it depends on the individual as it requires a certain dosage for it to work effectively.
4	moderately effective	the use of premarin reduced hot flashes and kept my skin looking younger. my skin doesnt look good since discontinuation of 
10	highly effective	lovenox is given in subsequent pregnancies to women with recurrent miscarriage due to autoimmune issues.  prior to taking lovenox, i had two second trimester losses and thanks to lovenox i was able to carry my two daughters to term.  it allowed my placenta to last the pregnancy without clotting and i was able to successfully have two children.
9	highly effective	i was severly depressed for weeks and would just cry all the time. i had tried several other antidepressants and none of them worked. one day my doctor said lets try a new drug called effexor xr. i was started on 75 mg for about 2 months and was still depressed so then i was increased to 150 mg and have been on it since. i an so much happier and my family is also. this medicine has been my life saver and recommend anyone depressed to take this one
9	highly effective	more energy and alertness, less fatigue & regular normal period duration. periods had been irregular, and often very heavy with severe cramps and clotting. mental attitude improved. i became less tired during the day and required fewer hours of sleep to feel fully rested. concentration improved and thought process seems much more clear after taking the medicine for about four months.
3	marginally effective	increased libido.
5	moderately effective	the treatment benefits are that i showed a slight decrease in wrinkles. i really think that if used with other products it could be better. i also used sunscreen everyday. i really didnt see a difference in the sagging of the skin . i thought it would help with collagen production. i am continuing to use the product. i hope i see a difference.
7	considerably effective	initially prescribed zoloft for depression , but after two weeks my condition was markedly worse. i realize that each of us have different tolerances to various substances, and after my gp changed the medication to daily of cymbalta my condition started to improve, but relapsed after about 3 weeks. the assumption was that i had required the higher dose of daily, and since taking daily my condition has improved to be close to my normal happy self with interests in various things. my advice is to find the medication that 'agrees' with you and stick with it for at least 1 month.

6	considerably effective	infection cleared up but the cough did not. the bronchitis returned and is still present. the z pack was used on 2 seperate occasions but after the cough mucus was back to a clear color, my physician said i was fine. it is 3 weeks later and i still have bronchitis and although my coughing is better it certainly is not gone.
8	considerably effective	stops persistent coughs in 30 days.
8	considerably effective	the benefits were great. i really liked because it didnt give me side effects like the other medication i used to take did. i would wake up in the day feeling refreshed. as i was taking for my schizophrenia  i would always wake up feeling exhausted and tired;still, even though i would take the medicine during the nights! i used to be stressed and aggravated all the time before and  now that im on  im emotionally numb and the voices in my head vanished. so i had a good nights sleep and didnt wake up as tired as used to make me. :]
8	highly effective	was able to study 6 hours in a row, pay attention in class rather than daydream, made me want to be perfect and learn everything.
10	highly effective	dramatic loss of weight and inches first week.  settled into meridia's program provided over the internet (comes with prescription .  promised myself to follow the rules.  the toughest for me, was not to weigh myself everyday.  meridia wanted me to check only once a week and im glad i refrained.  the thrill of seeing a huge difference each week has kept my knees from complaining.  the strength of meridia has never lessened.  if i forget to take it, i feel like the bottom of my floor has opened up and i am in free fall.  it really is strange...  when i take it with my vitamins each morning, it gives me a definite feeling of support.  i am loosing 2 lbs each week along with inches.  im doing better than what they advertise but that is probably because i have a gym in my home.  i walk 70 miles/mo. and do free weights.  i also love my whey protein porridge in the morning with blueberries, shake for lunch and balanced meal for dinner.  i do eat snacks.  a starbucks coffee (also made at home), with 1/2 an energy bar... or, an orange.  responsible eating.  i also understand the dynamics of over eating, being menopausal with depleted hormones.  meridia has been a life saver for me.  thanks to my fabulous doctor, who is also using it.
10	highly effective	i was having panic attacks and very high anxiety. effexor xr helped to reduce the anxiety and eliminate the panic attacks. my depression is much, much better.

10	highly effective	i no longer suffered from heartburn and acid reflux.  one pill per day allows me to enjoy eating again and have no adverse effects from any type of food.  at least none that i am aware of.
7	moderately effective	elevation of mood and clarity of thought.  progress stalled out at 300 mg, but with increase to 450 mg can tell the difference.  im able to finally think and plan ahead and chip away at all the clutter i've not been able to deal with which accumulated while depressed.
8	highly effective	i have tried so many anti depressants and always go back to zoloft.. works the best and is least expensive.. $10 a month compared to cymbalta for $400 a month.. it really works for me well.

1	moderately effective	did have elimination of frown lines and crows feet but no one cares about having wrinkles or not when you are paralyzed.  sadly wrinkles returned in 6 months but large nerves in my legs and and body continue to suffer daily with weakness several years later.   risks too great for some temporary cosmetic procedure
9	highly effective	after suffering a spinal cord injury in 1987 resulting in quadriplegia (c5/c6 complete), i experienced disassociated pain that was concentrated in my right thumb.  the problem got increasingly worse over the following years.  i ended up having to take a lot of ibuprofen and vicodin, just to relieve the pain announce to allow me to get some work done.  however, the resulting side effects caused me to sleep a lot.  it also lead to depression.  i was finally given a prescription for gabapentin to try out.  it started working almost immediately.  after about two weeks i was rarely having the pain in my thumb anymore.  it doesnt cause me to get sleepy or feel drugged (like the vicodin) so i have been able to work and concentrate on things once again.  it also seems to have helped with my depression, although that may have more to do with not having to deal with the pain, or the side effects of the pain relievers i was taking before.
1	ineffective	dexedrine as well as effexor, i found for my add works well the first few times, then the efficacy wears off because of tolerance.so now i take supplements, and find they work just as well but take 2 months to feel effects.

10	highly effective	i have my life back.  that is the main treatment benefit.i suffered from impulsive behaviors, probably the most harmful/dangerous of them being binge-eating and bulimia.  since taking lamictal at for 4 months now my eating habits have become completely normal.  i have not purged in 3 months.  this is amazing.  i would binge eat and purge because of anxiety.  now i feel like a normal person--not obsessed with food, i eat when i am hungry, stop when satiated.  i have lost a lot of weight (20 pounds in 3 months without dieting/counting calories, etc.)...nothing was wrong with my metabolism, it was the impulsive eating, stealing food from others, throwing it up (which gave me a high--not just to get rid of the calories, but it calmed me...).  i love the lamictal for this because it's not like some meds that make you lose weight by destroying the appetite.  i am just a normal person now!  i also quit the lexapro as it was triggering hypomanic episodes.  the lamictal is stabilizing my moods--it doesnt numb the depression like the ssris i have been on.  i feel things.  i am clear-headed.  but i am able to step back and not be hurt by every look i get from people, i am not paranoid anymore, i can wake up in the morning with energy and i fall asleep within 3 minutes of hitting the pillow.  i get sleepy at 10pm.  i am not hyper and can sit still for more than 2 minutes.  :-)all good for me.  this is the right medication for me...

10	highly effective	doctor prescribed acyclovir for cold sores and said it would reduce duration of cold sores. in fact, it has completely eliminated flare ups for over 5 years. before i started taking it, i would get a cold sore once or twice a year. it is very important to have a dose available at all times, because it is crucial to start taking it at the first sign of tingling. the effectiveness of this drug has far exceeded my expectations.

4	highly effective	in one year, i only had two periods. my periods before depo were 2-3 days and very light, on depo they were longer and heavier. it is so convenient not having to remember to take a pill everyday at the same day. it was also 100% effective with preventing pregnancy for me.

8	moderately effective	i feel the treatment was very helpful in keeping my skin clear looking,and i think somewhat tighter,  it also  gave my face a healthy color and appearance ,it was less dull the way aging skin can become. i also think it did keep some lines at bay.it gave me a much improved appearance,i have been using renova for a few years and i will continue to use this cream for a long time to come.
7	considerably effective	helped me to feel better.  lessened anxiety, panic attacks, tension, emotional exhaustion.  i was able to tolerate being around people better because talking did not seem so loud. once i was used to the drug, it helped me get out of bed and function in day to day life better (falling asleep & getting out of bed was a serious struggle).  eventually with the combined therapy, i pretty much now feel like myself again, just with less energy reserve and ability to have discipline with my routine.  (for instance, i can't get up early, during the 5am, 6am hours and get to work on time like i use to.  in fact im late for everything now which is out of my character) can' tolerate multiple loads of stress with calmness and collectivity like i use to.  otherwise day to day life is manageable as long as i obey my bodies new limitations.i didnt gain weight or increase in appetite.  i struggled with appetite actually and at times had to force myself to eat.
7	moderately effective	"the benefits of tamoxifen have been to be cancer free 2 years after my diagnosis. hopefully this ""clean bill of health"" will continue as i begin year 3 of tamoxifen in my 5 year plan. the benefits of effexor help balance the mood swings caused by a lowered amount of estrogen in my body. tamoxifen does its job by keeping the estrogen blocked in my body so any abnormal cells can't feed on the estrogen. my cancer was highly estrogen-positive. lowered estrogen causes depression and mood swings. effexor helps to alleviate these symptoms along with my exercise regime and healthy eating habits."
8	considerably effective	i had terrible itching, watery eyes, and sneezing from seasonal allergies.  this medication did not completely eliminate my symptoms, but is reduced them to a tolerable level without making me too tired or doped up to function at work.
10	highly effective	i lived in a constant state of panic (shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, flushed feeling), and this medication completely erased all these symptoms.  i can now think clearly and make rational decisions.  i chose to stay on this very low dose and take an ativan on the rare occasion a panic attack breaks through.

8	highly effective	i was diagnosed with bipolar ii disorder in february of 2009. i found that my manic states led to very erratic and inconsistent behavior. i also found the depressive lows to be particularly difficult to manage.in november 2009 i was prescribed seroquel by a urgent care physician. immediately i found its calming effects to be extremely relieving to my mania. i did, however, find it difficult to maintain a functioning state due to its sedating effects. i then switched to seroquel xr and found a much more successful experience. i was initially given seroquel xr paired with lexapro. while initially a good way to stop the mania, i found to be too much to function on. i decided to halve my seroquel xr dose to continuing to take of lexapro. this combo has been great and i am so much calmer and feel way more in control of my life. i do, however, find the sedating effects to be difficult upon awaking in the morning. i try to offset this by ensuring that i receive a full 8-10 hour rest after administering a dosage. i would highly recommend this combo to anyone that is having difficulty finding a mental balance between dark and light. this year of treatment has allowed me to find a calm that i have never quite experienced beforehand.

1	moderately effective	terrible!  there are much safer alternatives than this poison.  most fluoroquinolones have been taken off the market.  johnson and johnson should be ashamed of themselves.  they have not warned doctors properly of the serious side effects eventhough the fda has placed two black box warnings!

8	considerably effective	i switched from zoloft because the cymbalta wasn't supposed to effect libido negatively.  having ended my marriage and gone through menopause i don't feel i can judge that aspect fairly.  however, i feel the cymbalta is much more effective in keeping the dark cloud off my head, allowing me to be more positive toward life on a consistent basis.

10	highly effective	my son is generally very leary of any type of medicine and even throws up certain cough syrups and that i would give him.  i had two concerns for this oral medication.  first, i was skeptical that this prescription for amoxicillin would be any different in terms of taste and that my son would also throw it up.  also, being that my son is a diabetic coupled with the fact that he was sick, i was concerned that this medication might have sugars that would affect his blood sugar readings.  i found no real difference in his health for the first two to three days but in the days following, his health improved dramatically to the point where we almost forgot to take it.  understanding that the antibiotic needed to be taken for the full ten days in order to be the most effective, we continued to take it to the end of the ten days.

3	considerably effective	it provided me pain relief that enabled me to get up in the morning and pain relief that helped with cramps and pain while sleeping at night. i think it only blocked the pain receptor in my brain but didnt actually provide a cure for the main problem. it was like a mask that may have caused more damage in the end
10	highly effective	i have never felt so good in my life. this drug doesnt make you happy but it gives you a stable state to work from. i also read self-help books and have therapy along with the medicine but i wouldn't have been able to not have extreme highs and lows without lamotrigine. it saved my relationships and my sanity. thank god for this medicine.

5	highly effective	after moving to  allergies became a problem.  different medicines prescribed and over the counter were tried.  at one point, i had to visit the doctor every six months two get a b12 shot and a steroid shot.  i was not pleased with the such frequent visits to the doctor's office but needed a treat for my new found allergies that were really affecting my work and family life.

9	considerably effective	my target was to have the a cholesterol reduction from 240 to under 200. i did not want want to take statins because i am not comfortable with drugs that inhibit normal metabolic processes. evolution is parsimonious  and inhibition of any enzyme is likely to be reflected as an adverse effect in a seemingly unrelated area. also, i did not want to take red yeast rice, which basically is a non pharmaceutical grade of a statin. i liked the physical mode of action of zetia. within 6 months of starting treatment, my total cholesterol was down from to 200 and my hdl went up from 45 to 58.

9	highly effective	i have suffered from insomnia off and on for a number of years.   fluvoxamine is an antidepressant and, as i didnt feel depressed, i was a little dubious initially.  my gp suggested i try it as i was unwilling to take any sedative-type pills.  after the initial start-up period (around two weeks) i found it made a big difference.  i now go to bed and sleep normally without any side effects such as drowsiness.  my gp suggested that i might have had a level of depression which was affecting my sleep, i don't know, although i do feel better generally as well as sleeping well.

9	highly effective	the treatment benefits are long term.  there is no immediate benefit to be seen.  my doctor advised me that a follow-up scan should be performed in two years to determine if the treatment is effective in reversing or at least arresting the osteopenia.  the drug is supposed to reduce risk of breast cancer.

6	moderately effective	the zomig nasal spray is generally very effective in curing migraine. 80% of the time the pain is 75% or more gone within an hour. another 15% of the time it takes up to 2 hours.  5% of the time the pain is only lessen.  however lately some of the single dose units do not discharge the medication properly. instead of a spray, you get a drop or two.  when this happens, the frequency of the pain not going away by at least 75% goes up. a couple of times it seemed virtually ineffective.  if the quality control doesnt improve, i may have to switch to a different

9	considerably effective	at the onset of my condition of hives, i tried to avoid taking any medications and was hoping to ride it out.  by the second day, the itching got unbearable so i gave in and took benadryl to counteract the severe itching i was having.  at this stage, the hives were in full swing so the medication was only 50% effective but it helped enough for me to resist scratching myself.  as time went by, the itching slowly subsided and the hives went away (lasted about five days).

10	highly effective	this drug literally changed my life and i wish i had started taking it earlier in life.  so many problems would have been solved for me. i was never happy, cried often and had no self worth at all.  i was also very anxious and uncomfortable around people and avoided many social situations because of this.  in short i was not enjoying anything at all about life or work!  when i started taking zoloft (under my doctor' care) it was like a miracle for me.  i went back to school!  i pursued a new career (my old job was nothing other than a hiding place for me) i blossomed!  i honestly do not know if this drug has the same effect on everyone but i recommend trying it. i should be the poster child for zoloft.  i am still taking it and may be for the rest of my life.  as for people who complain about anti-depressants, there is only one thing to say to them, they obviously have never known the debilitating effects of depression!

1	considerably effective	significant reduction of pain due to the flu virus.  this is a typical prescription for the flu, pain killers with lots of fluids.  i was drawn to this tablets because they look appealing, the red capsules are easy to take and the caplets are coated in sugar. normally i'd take paracetamol, which are dry and hard to swallow, i choose these to be kind to myself !!!  i had no idea they could cause this reaction. they were good pain killers.
8	considerably effective	the use of prednisone before and during my vacation prevented the occurrence of the rash that i used to get due to sun exposure.  one year it did not totally prevent the rash and so the following year we increased the dosage.

8	considerably effective	went from approx. 17 migraine days a month to approx. 4 migraine days a month while taking topamax and erinn.  (before adding erinn, was down to approx. 8 migraine days a month.)  topamax seemed to greatly lessen the hypersensitivity of my brain to overreact to triggers such as changes in altitude, barometric pressures, humidity levels, environmental triggers such as smoke, strong smells, loud noises, and food triggers such as dark chocolate.  before topamax all of these things would cause migraines to start very easily.  after settling in on topamax these things didnt bother me like they used to.
10	highly effective	thought to have allergies - not the case however flonase works to clear the sinuses and prevent infections, works wonderfully!!
1	marginally effective	the neurontin slightly helped pain but not enough to contine the drug. it was supposed to help muscle spasms but did not.  i would not increase because of the side effects.

2	ineffective	none, i was unable to take  the drug to achieve the benefits as i had a reaction.
8	considerably effective	i did not see any significant benefits for treating the histamine reaction- which was due to a bug bite and subsequent allergic response.  sensations and symptoms included inflammation, redness, swelling to the point of limited mobility (bite was on hand) and itching, which the did not effectively treat; however, the appeared to help with the seasonal allergies related to hay fever.  for the topical condition, diphenhydramine was preferred.
3	ineffective	initially effective perhaps but doctors loath to discontinue after symptoms disappeared
8	considerably effective	reduced bad boils and acne on the skin surface
8	considerably effective	i had a nervous breakdown suddenly and unexpectedly.  after 1 week in the psych ward, i was prescribed 2 medications that i soon realized didnt help.  over the course of 1 year, i tried many different combinations of anti depressants which didnt work.  not until i tried both wellbutrin and together did i start recovering from my breakdown.  about 1 1/2 years ago i discontinued the and i've only used the wellbutrin since it helps me maintain my health.

10	highly effective	ritalin has saved my life from lethargy and procrastination   i can now focus and be productive.  i am participating in life now ... i wish i would have discovered this sooner.  but later is better than never, i am very grateful this drug exists.  it is not an amphetamine (which is good because i could get addicted to speed too easily), this does not amp me up, it makes me calm and inspired and focused, a huge change in my life.  i am actually enjoying being alive (which is saying a lot compared to where i was at before taking ritalin)
4	highly effective	it was 100% effective as contraception, the mayor benefit is not having to remember to take the pill every day and that it has only one form of hormone  which is important for woman over 35, especially smokers.
4	highly effective	the medicine mtx  was effective for fifteen years. weekly dose of enbrel is quiet effective. as son as i tke mtx 2 days after the enbrel injection i am having severe swelling on my knee joints. others remains normal.
10	highly effective	i had the drug initally offered to me by my dermatologist in sample tube years ago.  i found it very effective, despite only dabbing on the smallest amount due to only having small sample tube.  yet despite quick clear-ups...i would occasionally have recurrences under my nose with the rash.  i have struggled with this rash for over 20 years.  with the last outbreak, while having minimal amounts left in the sample tube, i went in to my dermatologist and got a full prescription in about june of 2009.  not only was i able to use a bit more in application this time, but it obviously was not an expired product.  i found the long-term rash hsf completely cleared up within less than a week.  while this was not new to me with this product, the fact that i have had no recurrence whatsoever in over four months is the great news.
10	highly effective	during the ten years i've been taking acyclovir, i have experienced zero outbreaks, compared to almost continuous outbreaks prior to taking this drug. i occasionally have the that precedes an outbreak, and have on two or three occasions taken an extra dose per day when i experience that symptom.

4	highly effective	no mood swings, easy birth control method..it was very convenient not having to take a pill everyday.
5	considerably effective	when i took zyrtec on a daily basis, my allergy symptoms were reduced.  i didnt appear to have the headaches (band around my head) as often nor did i have the pain in the ears associated with this band quite so frequently, my nose was not quite so 'runny' or itchy.  i found my nose clearer during the daytime and i had less 'sniffles' as compared to days when i did not take the zyrtec at all.  overall, it improved my symptoms notably.
8	highly effective	extremely effective in reducing anxiety and depression. makes you less self-conscious and able to go outside for walks, pass crowded patios without having to cross over to the other side of the street because you are afraid of being watched. highly effective in reducing irritability and increasing patience. a lot less side effects than other anti-depressants. you do not feel drowsy or drugged. neither do you get any stomach upsets.
2	ineffective	i felt ok for about two days when first starting the treatment, then the lovely side effects began to set in
1	ineffective	i took celexa for approximately 6 months and i found it to be totally ineffective. this was not surprising considering i have taken several other psychotropic (ssri's) drugs, with the same ineffectiveness. im finally thinking maybe i don't have a serotonin deficiency, and maybe there are other issues. going back to dr. to see if there may be another course of action.
8	considerably effective	there has been a noticeable reduction in acne. overall my skin is much smoother. i have sensitive skin and rosacea. it has not exasperated my rosacea like other tretinoin treatments have. i have been very happy with it. it's the best drug i've used for acne so far.
9	highly effective	about two years ago lexapro had totally stopped working and i was trying many different drugs from   cymbalta, none of which worked. after a few days on i experienced the worst panic attack ever. i thought the end was near. i had had them in the past, but nothing like this. it probably lasted only about 5 minutes but seemed an eternity. the rest of that particular day i was completely exhausted. that was a sunday and the following day my family doctor stopped all my meds and switched me over to clonazepam and zoloft. it's been a year now and i haven't felt this well in a long time. minimal side effects.
1	ineffective	i started with headaches on the 9th day of taking the medication. i eventually needed 2 yrs of spinal taps to reduce the fluid build on in my spinal cord which was putty pressure on my brain.

8	considerably effective	it initially worked great to eliminate my heart burn.  but it is now requiring 2 doses per day.  i take the 2nd pill not for burn but for congestion that builds up in my throat.
8	marginally effective	i'm using tretinoin to reduce the wrinkles around my eyes. so far i am happy with it- although even as an anti wrinkle treatment improves my skin- i continue to age- so it's an uphill battle. i do my best to take care of myself and had heard that this might help battle the little signs of age on my face. so far im pretty happy- nothing drastic, but hopefully continued use will help me to age gracefully and not drastically.
6	highly effective	prevention of pregnancy, lighter periods
10	highly effective	reduction or resolution of symptoms related to histamine release- variously sneezing, watery eyes, allergic rhinitis, wheeze (inhaled allergens), oral itching, severe abdominal cramping and diarrhoea ( ingested allergens ). i suffer from pollen allergy which has led to severe food allergies particularly to nuts. zyrtec works quickly within 15-30 minutes and causes no increased drowsiness, probably decreases it. ( the allergy itself makes one quite tired ).
8	considerably effective	significant reduction in perseveration; increased flexibility; reduction in obsessions such as the weather leading to ability to cope better with daily events, unexpected changes, disappointments etc.and increased ability to interact more appropriately socially
9	highly effective	reduced inflammation and acne lesions reduced inflammation and acne lesions reduced inflammation and acne lesions reduced inflammation and acne lesions reduced inflammation and acne lesions reduced inflammation and acne lesions reduced inflammation and acne lesions reduced inflammation and acne lesions

10	considerably effective	i was growing facial hair in a classic beard pattern.  not heavy, but more was coming in.  doc took a look at my testosterone levels and said they were too high. he told me to quit taking any dhea and to take in the morning and in the evening before bed. i didnt know that would counteract testosterone, but it does.  new facial hair quit coming in and there has been lessening of facial hair that was already there.
8	considerably effective	reduced anxiety, less irritability, moods.

9	considerably effective	able to cope more successfully during panic attacks and acute anxiety episodes. able to sleep better at night (get to sleep).
10	highly effective	occasionally, my rosacea would come out on my nose and sometimes result in huge, painful pimples which also made my entire nose red and swollen. this started occurring bi-weekly for the past year or so. i started using and haven't had an incident since!
6	considerably effective	the flare ups of fibromyalgia seemed to subside considerably. i was able to actually get out of bed during the day. i still, however, have bouts of pain; especially if i try to reduce the amount i take during the day.
2	ineffective	i didnt realize any benefits since the medication is preventative and needed to be taken over time to prevent osteoporosis. i had experienced some bone density issued related to  long term use of prednisone or a period of years.
8	considerably effective	for seasonal allergies, i would highly recommend zyrtec.  i have had allergy shots to no avail, and have suffered from seasonal allergies my whole life.  while the side effects that i experienced were annoying, they did not negate the benefits of taking the medicine. it made all of my allergy symptoms disappear (itchy eyes, hay fever  nasal congestion etc)  the side effects were extreme cotton mouth, and i mean extreme. it also very much interrupted a restful night sleep.  however, as annoying as these are, it was worth it to have the affect of the drug itself in dealing with seasonal allergies.
4	marginally effective	when i first started, i slowly made my way up to   after the first two months, i noticed a difference.  not a huge difference, but it was big enough for my family to notice.  it seemed to me though, after time, that my body got immune to the medication and i seemed to be back to the manic stages again.  i have been on tons of anti-depression medications that are prescribed for depression and bipolar disorder and it seems to my doctors/psychiatrists that my body just gets immune to them.
8	considerably effective	the chest pain went away almost immediately. i rarely had heartburn even when i ate spicy foods. even though i still may have heartburn occasionally, the tightness of my chest and the frequent indigestion has almost completely disappeared. before i had indigestion at random times during the day, which would cause unexpected chest pains.
2	ineffective	none
10	highly effective	amazing! i take nothing but this dot and add a dab of progesterone cream (natural) and vitamins. i have never felt better!
3	ineffective	no benefits that i can see.  my doctor said it was not useful to do another bone scan to see if there had been a change in a year so i have no idea if there was any benefit.  i have been experiencing fairly severe leg pains for the past year and could not find out what they were from.  did numerous tests, no results.  then i saw on the insert that side effects could be muscle, bone or joint pain and when i read a comment on here describing dull aching in one leg in particular radiating down from the hip and below the knee. i thought...that is me!!!  so i am stopping this drug and waiting to see what happens with the new aches and pains.  maybe it is this drug.  i hope so.

9	considerably effective	with the topamax alone, and not myself consciously changing any of my dietary habits or exercising, i lost about 10% of my body weight in the first two months of treatment. it was like a tiny switch in my brain was flipped and i just didnt crave gargantuan massive quantities of horrible-for-you food. not that food didnt taste good, or i wasn't hungry, i just filled up really quickly, and nothing seemed any more appealing than anything else. so when you're not just going off whatever looks yummy at that exact second and you actually stop and think about what you're about to eat, you tend to choose something a tad bit healthier and less caloric. combine that with the fact that it would take about half the amount to fill me up, and there you have your weight loss.

10	highly effective	i have found valium to be a godsend. it helps stave off migraine attacks, it helps me get to sleep when i have insomnia, and it relaxes  the muscles in my back when i get spasms. i use it sparingly, only when i really need it, (about 2-3 times a week ) and i have not found it to be addictive at all. i actually find it to be relatively mild, and i think it's over-regulated.

7	considerably effective	the best , best thing about wellbutrin is that i have my sex drive back fully and i am realizing how much i missed it. that has been fantastic. i have noticed some appetite suppression too, which seems to sort of come and go, but it's definitely a welcome side effect. i have been able to get a lot done at work, which is never a bad thing, but it's also unpredictable thus far. i also enjoy not having to deal with the nausea and overall sickness i would experience if i missed a dose of zoloft.

10	highly effective	reduced acne breakout, redness from breakout went away quickly, smoother skin
7	considerably effective	until remicade, i wasn't able to sleep without waking from the pain of moving my legs, so i ecstatic about that relief.  i no longer have any stiffness, except for when its cold or if i grip something for a while, but it doesnt last for hours like it used to.  the swelling in my joints has signficantly decreased.  unfortunately, the medicine has not stopped my flare-ups, which only last for a 2 at a time on a finger joint or toe joint.  nor has it prevented osteoarthritis in my feet.  i am also struggling to find that right dose that helps with the fatigue.
1	ineffective	none.
1	moderately effective	the benefits were almost non-existent. i had taken this med before after a terrible car accident and therefore felt secure enough to take it again this time. however after only one day medicine stopped being effective.

10	highly effective	long-time smokers finally have something to help them stop smoking and not have the headaches and the withdrawals!
7	marginally effective	i only took it one time, and experienced a side effect (dry mouth). did not really kick in, but i guess this med. is not supposed to work immediately
9	considerably effective	the skin texture appears improved after only 4 weeks of use. i have much acne less breakouts and day by day i see a steady improvement. my skin is much smoother than before and starts having a beautiful glow (which it hasn't had in years!)

6	moderately effective	it seemed to stabilize my metabolism.
8	highly effective	i had severe acne for many years and i was sort of living with it without seeking cures seriously. i tried a couple of other anti-biotics before but not very diligently. i started to be more disciplined and actually took every day. in the beginning i was also taking apri the birth control pill. i took both for a couple of months and my face started to be better in a week or two and completely cleared in a couple of months - which made me so much happier with my life. then i stop apri, and i continued with  and it seems that if i stop  my acne will come back a little. so i have not tried stoping for more than a week or two. i am a little concerned with the long term side effects of although i am not sure whether there should be any. i think i will continue taking and i will also ask my doctor to test blood or any other things that i should be cautious of.
3	moderately effective	the benefits if i had continued to take the malarone for the entire two weeks would have been to not contract malaria.  but the side effects were severe enough that i discontinued treatment and followed other preventative measures.
10	highly effective	periods became lighter and more regular, acne lessened as well.
4	marginally effective	as an rn for 14 years, i was familiar with detrol la and why it was prescribed for me.  i was diagnosed two years ago with multiple sclerosis and have a spastic bladder.  soon after being prescribed detrol la, i had a definite decrease in urination frequency.  however, after about six months, my urinary habits returned to pre-medication levels.  i void every two hours.  about one year ago, i stopped taking detrol la for two months, thinking that giving my bladder a break from the med would help.  i then restarted detrol la and noticed no difference.  i am seriously thinking about stopping the medication.  it is essentially useless.

9	considerably effective	i have been suffering with pain almost every day of my life since i went to the dentist and my tmj was diagnosed. i couldnt find anything to help me with the pain and found this medical condition debilitating. insurance wont pay for specialists and/or treatments for this condition. my pcp gave me a prescription for this medication and it so far has really really helped the pain. i take it twice a day with a meal (very important) and the pain level has decreased so much! i know everyone's condition effects them differently but after trying over the counter medications as well as pain medication prescribed by my pcp this has been the most helpful so far. thank you meloxicam!
7	considerably effective	increased learning capability + focus, happier
7	moderately effective	i was prescribed norvasc by my cardiologist because i kept having left sided chest pain. my doctor stated it wasn't angina because im so young. i had an echo and stress test which were all normal. each day after taking the pill, i find relief in the chest pain for a while, but then after about an hour it will sometimes come back. i have noticed increase in headaches since taking this med which i went to see a neurologist who wanted me to take neurontin but i refuse to take. he stated the headaches have nothing to do with the heart, but i disagree because when i have this chest pain, the headaches usually are there to, and when the chest pain isnt there, the headache isnt there.
10	highly effective	my cholesterol was significantly lowered.  from 230 to about 170.  the ratio was excellent.  this effect has consistently been monitored and remains steady.
7	considerably effective	the number one benefit was that it helped with the mood swings.  i no longer felt like i was having a mental breakdown.  i felt like i have had more control over my emotions, being that i could be upset and crying one minute and then just fine the next.

9	highly effective	quality of life improved 10 fold.  able to follow through with hobbies and interests as well as work.  before treatment, memory was nonexistent. after treatment not only could i remember things but time itself changed.  time seemed to move faster.  the body, down to a cellular level, processes toxins faster so skin becomes clear and perfect.
1	ineffective	i can not say i can recall any positive benefits.
7	moderately effective	elevation of mood and clarity of thought.  progress stalled out at 300 mg, but with increase to 450 mg can tell the difference.  im able to finally think and plan ahead and chip away at all the clutter i've not been able to deal with which accumulated while depressed.
9	highly effective	to date improvements i've noted (but confirmed by closest): seizures viewed much fewer & shorter.  50% of the seizures merely feelings & no communication loss.  much more clarity, energy & strength, alertness vs. drowsiness.  moods much better with smiling even during difficult times.
7	moderately effective	elevation of mood and clarity of thought.  progress stalled out at 300 mg, but with increase to 450 mg can tell the difference.  im able to finally think and plan ahead and chip away at all the clutter i've not been able to deal with which accumulated while depressed.
9	considerably effective	i am definitely more able to manage my emotions and feelings. i can speak on the telephone to people, be in person around people i've never met, and function in society in general. this doesnt sound like a big feat, but i had crippling anxiety and it's a giant step for me.
8	considerably effective	the treatment benefits were good because i had mrsa and have for my 3rd time in 2 1/2 months.the itchiness goes away,quick working,and does work.though i feel with mrsa,treatment should be longer,and a slightly higher dose.due to the chance it not being wiped out of body entirely.the 2nd time i got mrsa,it took care of it,but not entirely.made boil the size of a sand grain ,or rice maybe?!..now on it again,for 30 days,and began taking today.no results yet.
2	marginally effective	arthritis med/tramadol hlc only helps a little with arthritis pain. keeps it down to a dull roar!diabetes meds,helped lower blood levels. kept a1c under 7%. made it safe to live a normal life by keeping blood sugar under control. helped keep disease & diabetes out of eyes. help kidneys function normal.
9	considerably effective	the combination of the two drugs helped me cope with my pain and depression, which seem to be related.  im able to cope with most of life's difficulties and am not sleeping as much.  with the vicodin helping with the pain, when i do sleep i find it's much more restful and satisfying.  i still have a long way to go and i believe that i will need to take these two drugs for a while as i tried quitting the prozac and immediately resumed the depression.
10	highly effective	the medication reduced total cholesterol from about 220 to about 180.  blood pressure appeared to slightly decrease from 125/70 to 115/65. the ration between high density cholesterol (good cholesterol) to low density cholesterol improved significantly.

7	moderately effective	stomach had been aching continually for several months, with constant belching and a feeling of pressure in the upper throat.  heartburn was not a significant complaint.  i lost about 5 lbs due to a loss of appetite.  i first started on a dose of 20 mg/day, and decided to increase to 40mg/day when the symptoms were not fully alleviated.  that dosage helped the symptoms, but i still have to be careful when, what and how much i eat or the problem will start up.
6	moderately effective	had an abnormally increased sex drive and was subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer 8 months later.  makes me wonder what the hell was in this drug.

10	considerably effective	after the third day, i could tell the pain was subsiding.
5	highly effective	cleared up infection
9	highly effective	"the crown of my head was almost totally bald at age 54 and the remaining hair very thin.  the front of my head was transplanted.  if you looked at me in the daylight, you would say that i had a ""balding problem"" and of course with the transplants i looked strange  after 6 months, it totally covered my crown and increased the texture of the remaining hair to a coarser density.  all of the fine hairs which were dormant came back with stronger and previous-strength follicles.  the transplanted hair on the top also became coarser.  except in a very strong light looking directly down on the top of my head, now no one would say i was bald or even ""thinning.""  i am totally amazed with this product at age 55 and should have started taking it at 25."

10	highly effective	i tried all the popular medical treatments for including synthroid; combinations of t3 and t4; etc. etc.  either these treatments were ineffective (i.e. would raise my ths but leave me feeling fatigued) or would leave my heart racing. armour thyroid was the only effective treatment
9	highly effective	gave son the confidence to go to sleep as he had been staying awake - worried to sleep for fear of wetting the bed, proved to son not his fault as he blamed himself, helped with washing of bedding every day - stress. gave son the confidence to sleep at other venues loke friends houses, he would never have done that
7	considerably effective	focalin xr reduced the severity of adhd symptoms.  it increased attention and reduced fidgeting.  also noticed an increased productivity at work and better interpersonal interactions.  additionally, the xr formulation is easier to take properly because it only has to be taken once a day, versus 3 - 4 times a day for the non extended release formula.
10	highly effective	you take the pills for 90 days, daily.  you only get your period 4 times/year.  some people have breakthough bleeding but i didnt have any bleeding. i didnt take the placebos, i started the next 90 day pack of pills and skipped my period.
8	highly effective	reduction in cholesterol level and gave me more energy as well as making me feel better. it is a medication that combines zocor and zetia. zocor works on the production of cholesterol in the liver and works on absorption of cholesterol in the digestive system
1	ineffective	proven effective with adults and was tried with me to combat severe depression, regardless of the fact that it is not normally recommended for adolescents. though starting at 37.5 mg, the psychiatrist quadrupled the dosages within one month's time to attempt to make a dent on my emotional condition.
8	considerably effective	yes, i had taken prozac for fourteen to fifteen years for the treatment of depression and experienced a loss of sexual desire. i tried the wellbutrin xl in the hopes that it would not produce this side effect starting about 18 months ago. the wellbutrin xl does not have this side effect in my experience.
8	highly effective	virtually stopped joint and then digestive flares entirely.
8	considerably effective	noticed a quick increase, and then a complete decrease in hair shedding. perhaps after the 1st week i thought my hair loss increased, then it's like the hair that remained all strengthened, and then, the small hairs that shed started up new growth. i did not notice any viable new growth at the temple region, but the vertex and high forehead areas seem to be thicker and younger and better hairs then i had 6 months ago. i look forward to a 2 year review!
7	moderately effective	reduced the level of thyroid hormone, thereby minimizing many of the hyperthyroid symptoms.
3	highly effective	the treatment cured the sore throat for which it was prescribed 
5	moderately effective	it subsided inflammation in the intestines.  therefore resulting pain and discomfort.  hopefully less diarrhea.
6	highly effective	the psoriasis cleared up a great deal on my hands and scalp, back and feet. the pain level was dramatically decreased and i was able to cut back a lot on the anti inflammatory drugs i had to take when i had a bad flareup. i was able to sleep deeper and longer.
9	considerably effective	"helps me focus at work in the corporate world.  also helps me to ""think"" before i blurt out the first thing that comes to mind."
3	considerably effective	how would i know?  i guess it prevented a bad infection.
7	considerably effective	lighter periods, clearing of acne for the first 6-7 months.
9	highly effective	overall, the benefits have been very good.  a rescue inhaler hasn't been used in more than a year, nor has there been a severe asthma attack.  during the period there may have been three incidences where it seemed like an attack was coming on (curing exertion and cold, damp weather) but simply a better environment and a couple of cups of coffee warded it off.  there are times of wheezy, heavy  but these are minimal in comparison to prior to taking advair.
7	highly effective	complete cessation of my acne....effects lasted for about 2 -3 years
8	considerably effective	i have had problems falling asleep for many years. i had tried various other medicines, both over the counter and prescription, and nothing seemed to work - some didnt work at all, some helped me initially fall asleep but woke me up in the middle of the night, and others made me tired and feeling as if i were drugged the next morning. then one day, my dentist prescribed one ativan to take before bedtime the night before an extraction, and i actually fell asleep standing up! this is the first sleep medication that helps me initially fall asleep, sleep through the night, and doesnt make me feel tired the next day. plus, it has the added benefit of helping to reduce my worry, anxiety, and stress that had always kept me from falling asleep before.
7	moderately effective	i am taking lipitor to lower my cholesterol level.  it did lower it by a few points. i am taking it more as a preventative medicine.
9	ineffective	helped me sleep better but it si short acting for hours, have to take another in the middle of the night. helped reduce pack pain
1	ineffective	one dose don't know
10	highly effective	"greatly reduced severe migraines that were occurring almost daily.  this drug was added as a preventative medication when migraines became so debilitating that i could not function in everyday life, i.e., go to work, take care of self and family, etc.  migraines were reduced after approximately 6-8 weeks on the medication to about 1 per month and then continually reduced to 1 every 3 to 6 months as i stayed on the medication.  i also use the medication to manage my mood disorder (bi-polar disorder) and was able to not have to take a mood  because this drug also manages to keep me from getting ""manic"", so it is an extra ""bonus"" on top of the migraine management!!"
1	considerably effective	blood pressure under control
10	highly effective	the inflammation and redness around chin area was almost entirely cured, the skin was softer and smoother.
9	highly effective	within a week, i felt as if dark cloud of loneliness and unbearable sadness had drifted away.
2	ineffective	none due to the short time taking drug.
10	highly effective	the treatment completely cleared up the rash on my hands, usually in just a few days. since it was a foam i could apply it easily and there was no residue.
9	considerably effective	i have chronic allergies because i am allergic to dust rather than a seasonal allergen, like ragweed. i have tried many products, but typically they are so drying that i am forced to discontinue use. this product is effective at reducing the production of mucus and eye irritation from a sever allergy to dust. i haven;t used this
8	highly effective	able to function at job and sleep with neck pain. addressed tension and inflammation issues that allowed me to be able to use my arms freely and to also be able to lay on my neck at night to be able to sleep.
8	considerably effective	after menopause, i experienced painful intercourse and some bleeding caused by vaginal dryness. i tried over-the-counter lubricants including suppositories but found them to be inconsistent and they also masked sensitivity in the area.
10	highly effective	the treatment benefits of taking synthroid have everything to do with metabolism regulation.  because i had thyroid cancer the entire thyroid was removed.  since thyroid hormone keeps the body running at optimum speed, it is now essential for me to take medication that will accomplish what my body is no longer capable of doing on its own.
1	ineffective	none.
9	highly effective	the treatment eased pain very efficiently. i had no pain all day after just 3 pills. besides, i did not feel numb or anything, only the pain went away.
10	highly effective	i saw a large improvement in my skin which had become very dry and flaky on my legs and also on my face.  i have a blood test every year and after the initial experimenting with the dosage which started at .50 my thyroid levels are normal.
1	marginally effective	highly effective for sleeping.
9	considerably effective	decreased headache pain from 10/10 to 0/10 within a few hours. took at least 30 minutes to feel pain start to decrease, then causes fatigue. i like the fact that it disintegrates  because vomiting is often associated with my headaches and i am never sure how much medication is retained afterward if i have taken a tablet.

1	moderately effective	lowered blood pressure
4	moderately effective	the drug helped with sleep, but was inconsistent. i was a chronic insomniac, rarely sleeping more than 5 hours a night, often less.  with amitriptyline i was able to sleep more regularly (although not always), thereby alleviating some of the symptoms of depression and living more functionally on the whole.
5	considerably effective	cleared up nasal passages pretty well.  was about as effective as  but longer lasting.
8	considerably effective	i have seasonal allergies and especially in the spring and fall, my eyes itch and get dry. these drops contain anti-histamines that are delivered directly into the eye, and therefore are more effective than just using anti-histamine pills. i think they also helped with the eczema-like flaking on my eyelids but i cannot be sure because i was also using anti-histamine pills at the time.
9	highly effective	fewer hot flashes & irritability.
3	marginally effective	cleared acne, dried skin out considerably. was very easy to use. did not take much to use. no smell or fragrance.

10	highly effective	changed my life- for the better
8	considerably effective	sleep well
7	considerably effective	my libido increased and energy. i have really bad anxiety, it actually helped it..my mood really hasn't changed much. i seen happier because of the weight loss. it's a good program if you want to loose a lot of weight..
10	highly effective	i have been taking this treatment for 4 years and the goal is to prevent any more bone loss and possibly to improve it. combined with weight bearing exercise supposedly my bone loss will change.  i had a test a year after i started taking and there was slight improvement; i have not had another test since. i will be due for a test my next annual obg visit.
7	moderately effective	there was a noticable smoothing of the skin and lightening of age spots.

8	considerably effective	the decrease in anxiety greatly increased the quality of life for the patient.
8	considerably effective	adderall allowed me to start and finish projects. it also gave me energy. i am not a coffee drinker, so adderall was like my morning coffee  it sometimes would give me a feeling of mild euphoria, which was nice. certain tasks (like cleaning the house!) didnt seem so difficult because i would not get distracted by other things.
10	highly effective	after taking i no longer suffer from my horrible symptoms of my allergic rhinitis if i miss a tablet the symptoms are back almost immediately but after taking after an hour my symptoms almost disappear  i now sleep better as my symptoms usually worsen at night and i can visit friends and family with pets now. before i couldnt as i have severe reaction to fur.
9	highly effective	the killed off the effects of the parasitic illness which included extreme fatigue, chronic diarrhea, dehydration, and weight loss.  the celexa was effective in elevating my mood which had been diagnosed as depression.  it was the doctors belief that the long term effects of the parasite presence in my body led to my decline in physical and mental health.  i continued on the generic form of celexa, citalopram for a total of three years.  i no longer take medication for depression and my health is quite good.
2	ineffective	didnt really see any improvements but not sure if i am applying correct amount.
10	highly effective	prior to taking the amoxicillin i was in a lot of discomfort including tightness in the chest, fever, painful cough and difficulty in breathing. this meant that i was not able to work and had to stay in bed. the effects of the amoxicillin was almost immediate in that within two hours of taking the drug many of they symptoms had diminished considerably; in particular, breathing was no longer difficult or painful and the fever was reduced. due to the rapid improvement of my condition following the first few doses of amoxicillin i was able to return to work almost immediately.
8	highly effective	incidents reduced from daily to maybe every 6 to 8 weeks.  if i missed my dose however by hour 14 i would start to break out.  this would indicate to me that the histamine levels are ever present and the histamine blocker is what is keeping their ill effects at bay.  i have however discovered that recently my pharmacy changed their generic manufacturer and the new version is very ineffective.  i've had 5+ severe breakouts in 3 months
9	highly effective	clearer skin, did not affect weight
10	highly effective	after a week of taking 20 mg a day, i went from suicidal to genuine happiness. i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder and my symptoms have already gotten 90% better. my level of stress is very, very low and my depression is pretty much gone. i can go back to doing things i love and i have more energy to go about my day. only thing is that i also have insomnia and although it has calmed my nightly discomfort, it has not helped me sleep. but im waiting for it to help since my doctor said it would take time. i would recommend this drug to anyone!
10	highly effective	eliminated the irregular heart beat as well as the occasional heart racing in addition to controlling the blood pressure.  initially started taking while on birth control and having stress sytems of a racing heart beat.

1	ineffective	intended to produce more follicles to increase chances of conception, in combination with intrauterine insemination.  i had 5 rounds of treatment, though im not sure why the doctor chose to try this many times when none of the early tries were successful.  some stimulation occurred - 7-10 follicles were stimulated with each treatment - but conception did not occur.

7	considerably effective	nexium does help in controlling reflux, but i haven't gone without it in so long that i don't know how my reflux would do on its own.  it isnt a complete fix.  i can't blame the drug for this, but it doesnt help at all if i drink caffeine.
10	highly effective	completely eliminated my heartburn and reflux, which were a daily occurence and were not treated effectively with otc medications like pepcid.
3	moderately effective	mild to moderate relief of back pain

1	marginally effective	it seemed to work at first, but then the side effects started. fatigue, severe memory loss, poor decisions, urinary incontinence, personality changes (crabby, irritable, withdrawn). the hard part is i can't seem to get off this stuff!! the withdrawals are horrible, shakiness, feelings of doom, loss of appetite, nausea, palpitations. it scares me so much that i just start taking it again. im stuck!! don't ever start this stuff, there is something wrong with it. i don't know if i will ever be myself again.

8	moderately effective	ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male-pattern baldness. so far, one month in, there is not a great deal to report. i expected my hair loss to temporarily increase, as i had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate, they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. in other word, hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months, and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. so far, this has not occurred. the product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place, so i really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential. in terms of halting the process, however, i must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning, so it's possible the drug is having an effect already. i will post a fuller report in another forty-seven months, i suppose.

10	highly effective	i had   persistent periodontal problems, both stressful and painful.  every dentist i saw  told me i was going to lose my teeth.  this drug  cleared up the condition.  it protected me against inflammation for the entire period of time that i took it.  i continued taking the drug much longer than is usually recommended because it was so effective. the effectiveness did not seem to diminish.

7	considerably effective	the drug was pretty good for pain. they had me on morphine, which was horrible. the pain was preferable to the crazy dreams and paranoia i had. they then tried oxycontin, which was the best pain drug they gave me, but too addictive... so they moved me to vicodin products, which worked pretty well, with surprisingly few side effects.

9	highly effective	at the recommendation of the life extension foundation, i was taking 1850 mg per day of metformin prophylactically -- as an anti-aging medicine. gene assay testing by that metformin suppresses the gene, acting as a calorie reduction memetic. calorie reduction is the only currently proven way to extend life span, and the hope is that metformin will mimic this.

10	highly effective	face cleared up considerably  it took about 2 months for the drug to become considerably effective though.

10	considerably effective	for the first time in my life, i had enough eyelashes to apply mascara to.  i had tried eyelash extensions previously but they only worsened the problem by breaking off or pulling out what skimpy lashes i did have.  after several months of latisse i have eyelashes and even though i apply it only to upper lashes it has made lower lashes grow too.

5	considerably effective	chantix did effectively reduce the urge to have a cigarette.  taken twice per day was most effective, but side effects precluded that dosage for this patient(see below). chantix was taken in the morning, and patient rarely, if ever, even thought of wanting or 'needing' a cigarette during the day.  in the evening, however, (when the second pill was due to be taken, but wasn't), and especially if patient had an alcoholic beverage, the urge to smoke returned  with a vengence, though a few puffs were all it took to kill the urge.  when patient stopped taking chantix (after a year of use), the urge for nicotine returned.

10	highly effective	the medicine keeps me calm under all circumstances, and helps me to sleep at night. i used to have panic attacks at times before i began using this medicine. now the panic attacks are few and far between. although i do not like to drive while taking the medicine, if i must i can with no problems. in social situations i am much more myself and can relax and have fun. i have had 3 mini-strokes. since i began treatment with xanax i have not had a single episode.
9	highly effective	"before lexapro i was so depressed i could not function. i forced myself to work, and would come home exhausted. i had suicidal ideation and severe anxiety. i had ""bouts"" of depression before, but was never treated. my separation and death of my mother and loss of my job in one years time pushed me past what i could get myself out of. i was irritable, unsociable, had no desire to eat (lost 50 lbs that i could stand to lose in 6 months), cried all the time. i started lexapro 3 months ago, almost 4. i began at 10 mg and it was upped to 20 mg. i feel like i am starting to have my life back. i laugh again (genuinely). i can get up for work, i can socialize. i still have days where i feel like crying and am very scared.. but it passes quickly. i have almost regained my general sense of optimism again.

10	highly effective	i've been on yasmin four years now, it works so great! i have no side effects, just nausea if i take two at a time and that is hardly ever.  but my acne completely went away and no pregnancy the whole time i've been on it! would definitely recommend to anybody.

7	considerably effective	was often so tired that i barely got through my work day and would go home and sleep.  my quality of life was pretty much non-existant as i didnt enjoy anthing because i was always too tired.  when i started provigil i quit feeling like i always needed a nap and was able to make plans with friends because i had the energy to do more than just get through 9 to 11 hour work days.
10	highly effective	my legs used to jump pretty badly and so did my arms every night about 60 times per hour, that's once a minute.  sometimes it would wake me up and other times i didnt even know i was doing it, but the doctor told me that it was still disturbing my sleep.  while taking this drug, my legs and arms only jumped about 3 times in a 6 hr period.  all documented on sleep studies.
10	highly effective	helps with concentration and staying focused. helps to keep me from being hyperactive and fidgety and helps with memory to an extent.
9	considerably effective	the treatment benefits of taking provera were very good. i had very irregular menses that lasted for long periods of time.  by taking the provera day 15-26 of my cycle my periods began to normalize and become regular again.

2	considerably effective	it seemed to help make me not want to smoke. i seemed to not even think about smoking at times i would normally smoke. i think it would be very effective if the side effects so great.
10	highly effective	personally, i found metronidazole to be an equivalent to a concentration drug, it severely improved my intelligence and my overall concentration, i realise now that this drug, as it may be depressing, a new chapter in my life.during the medication i received, i was severely depressed, however it got me thinking deeply towards why i was indeed depressed, and thus, i came to a solution.it completely destroyed the bacteria that was within my abscess and treated me within 3 days, and aided my mind alot.within my experience with metronidazole, i have only to thank it for my a* papers and my mental health.with that i have only this to say:take it, it aids the physical problems you have, and if your like me at all, with greater ambitions than any human can dream,  this will make you realise all the problems you encounter, and it will cleanse you of your worries.

9	highly effective	after the first two shots i had no more periods until after being off depo provera for nearly 3 months. also i didnt get pregnant, which was the goal. before getting on birth control i had been a very moody person, fighting often with people who were important to me and whom i really didnt want to fight. on the shot i still had mood swings but they were not nearly as strong.
6	moderately effective	so far so good. will know more after six month mark when x-rays are taken to see if pockets are closing. one area that was highly inflamed before the deep cleaning appears to be healing well. no inflammation there and more pink as opposed to the red color it was before.
1	ineffective	i started this medicine to help my acne, but after a couple of weeks there was no improvement at all.  in fact, my skin was worse. i've taken other antibiotics in the past and they were much more effective at clearing up my skin.  so i stopped taking the 
10	highly effective	suboxone is beneficial for two reasons:1) it eliminated the opiate withdrawal when i was kicking my original drug of choice.2) as a maintenance drug, suboxone eliminates the cravings that i would normally have for opioids, as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids (heroin, oxycodone, etc.) so that there is no temptation to take these drugs.instead of struggling every day to avoid taking opioid drugs (and all of the terrible thing that come with being in active addiction) i can take suboxone and move on with life. suboxone may have quite literally saved my life.
2	ineffective	i could not see any benefits. i certainly did not feel any more emotionally balanced or stable than before.
10	highly effective	this treatment was easy to remember to take at only one time daily.  although i didnt miss any dose times, if i had, the directions state to take the missed dose, unless it is almost time for the next dose time which would be the following day after the missed dose.  if the latter being so, then one should wait for the next dosage.

9	highly effective	it allowed me to feel good enough to ignore and not be bothered by persistent thoughts and anxiety that i could not ignore before. basically it leveled me out, where the anxiety didnt affect me anymore.
2	moderately effective	at first, could actually sleep. the sleep issue has been life long and various natural things helped but not always.  as stress increased, nothing helped,not even the ativan.

5	marginally effective	decreased redness and by day 6. i believe the benefits were associated with the prescribed medication. however, i was also using a histamine blocking topical cream during the course of treatment.
8	considerably effective	the prevacid allows me to eat and drink certain foods/fluids that i normally could not tolerate anymore without great discomfort i.e. spicy foods, coffee, chocolate, tomato products, and alcoholic drinks, which i only drink occassionally such as red wine.  if i skip the prevacid for any reason, i almost certainly will be very uncomfortable.
10	moderately effective	i very mildly scratched my left ankle (right on the protruding bone) while snorkeling in the ocean. the abrasion was so small that i didnt do any first aid other than wash the area off when showering.over the next 3 days the are became inflamed and i began to apply antibiotic powder to try to dry the inflamed area.on the 4th morning the tiny scratch had developed to the point were the abrasion was an oozing sore about the size of a quarter and my foot was red and swollen making it impossible to put on a shoe.i immediately went to a local doctor who prescribed tablets.the drug was very effective and the effects could be felt within 24 hours.
8	considerably effective	my daughter suffered from an outbreak of painful skin boils on her lower back and stomach, probably 6 total over a few weeks.  they would heal individually after draining (also painful) but more would continually form.  the doctor diagnosed them as caused by mrsa and prescribed along with daily washes with soap.  it took 5 days for one very large, undrained boil to heal, but it did heal without draining.  more importantly, the boils stopped forming.
10	highly effective	'was diagnosed with h1n1 and was ill for at little past 3 weeks.  my doctor gave me a prescription for tamiflu (2 x day for 5 days) on the 3rd day after becoming rapidly ill (onset of high fever -- temp went from 102.8 to 103.2 pretty fast).  within a few minutes (15 - 20?) after taking it, i noticed i would feel better, and i'd start coughing up mucus from the lungs.  the feeling wore off after a few hours.  i was able to complete the full 5-day course.

3	marginally effective	there was very little benefit to me. i was having psychotic episodes every day. the drug purportedly taken to stop the episodes did nothing. the best thing it did was make me drowsy and help me sleep.

8	considerably effective	lessening of nerve pain, decrease in depression. medication will be increased as necessary  decrease in  shaking. exercise is needed to truly relieve pain. water based therapy can definitely add to relief from pain. depression medication helps, relieving the other symptoms, and can increase sleep. in general all treatments, lyrica, anti-depressants, muscle relaxers and exercise program (including stretching, weight-resistance, aerobic and endurance training and water exercises - this should be followed religiously) combined contribute to relieving pain, depression, control weight gain, and give patient back some resemblance of a normal live.
9	highly effective	this medication saved my life. the depression had gotten so sever that i was unable to function properly. it has made me feel like a 'real' person again. it has not done much for the anxiety, panic, or ocd. the xanax helps with that area. i will be going to the psychiatrist in 2 weeks for the anxiety, panic, and ocd. hoping to stay on the cymbalta. i was on lexapro from 2000-2006. then switched to celexa (cost reasons) from 2007-2008. the celexa just about costed me my life. it was ineffective for the depression. try not to take celexa for cost reasons, lexapro shows much more promise in its effectiveness.

10	highly effective	the product took great care of my razor bumps.  if i applied it at night, i was clear by the morning.  i only stopped taking it as the condition itself lessened.
10	highly effective	after having this virus for many years i resolved that i was going to look for a possible suppressant. as the medical community acknowledges once you have contacted the virus it will be awaiting an opportunity to break through - especially in times of stress or tiredness. prior to taking valtrex i was having a viral herpes attack for about 10 days at a time at least four times a year, sometimes 8 times a year.valtrex is an amazing drug!my experience has been that  if you take a tablet each day you will not transmit the virus to your partner provided that you pay attention to the first signs of the virus and abstain from intimate sexual encounters for five days or so or until you can feel or see no more signs of the virus.to be honest it frustrates me that so many people suffer from this virus but are not informed as to how to treat the problem.hope this helps and gives encouragement. for me it has been on par with a miracle. since taking the drug once daily i have had one only one potential outbreak in the past two and a half  years- at the onset of the potential outbreak i increased the dose to 3  tablets a day twice a day day for four days. this treatment suppressed the outbreak and the symptoms which i felt appeared very slightly and then disappeared within 48 hours.
8	considerably effective	if i took the zovirax at the first sign of tingling it would prevent an outbreak.  if i waited i would still get blisters but they would only last 2-3 days.

10	highly effective	it has totally neutralized the effects of my reflux.
9	considerably effective	after i built up a tolerance, i had little peeling when i applied it only once a day. used in combination with  caplets (and also topical, used occasionally), i have been able to control deep acne cysts. while the  is probably the major factor, the retin-a is a good addition.
10	highly effective	relpax would take the migraine headache away, including secondary symptoms such as neck aches, jaw pain, and nausea.
10	highly effective	i got pregnant.
7	considerably effective	in comparison with other anti depression medications i have taken prior to the effexor, it actually began working faster than the others (after about 2 weeks).  most antidepressants usually take closer to 4 weeks to see improvements. depression symptoms were significantly reduced.
9	highly effective	had surgery on my neck, the reduce the pain.the help relieve th pain upto eight hours so i did not need to take as many pills to find release. this is a good thing because i do not like pills.  this medication helped tremendously

4	considerably effective	i had the accutane treatment in 1997 and the short term results (6 months - 1 years) were fantastic, with the exception that the treatment left a big scar on my face and there is nothing i can do about it. after a year i began to have acne breakouts again. now, six years later, i am also having breakouts in my back and in new places like my neck, chest, behind my ears and (believe it or not!) some in my belly. when i when back for another opinion, they wanted me to have a second accutane treatment -- no way! also, after the treatment i can't live without chapstick... my lips are always very dry. hope this helps somebody out there! bea

8	highly effective	the benefits of celexa have been surprising and welcome.  over the past 15 years i've been given every anti-depressant the doctors could think of.  most had no effect at all, some had such uncomfortable side effects that i couldnt take them long enough to find out if they would help at all.  one (i can't remember the name) actually lifted my depression almost immediately and made me feel great, but after about 3 weeks i was suddenly plunged into a depression that was darker and more frightening than any i'd experienced before.  i stopped taking it.

10	highly effective	"subutex is mostly used to help opiate addicts withdrawal more comfortably from opioid drugs such as vicodin, oxycodone, and even heroin. however, i was started on subutex because my doctor and i were having no luck finding another med that would augment my current depression medications of effexor xr and adderall (which were only partially working). my doctor had found research suggesting that subutex, because it is a partial opiate agonist itself (although much different in its properties compared to what most think of when thinking ""opiate""), binds to one of the opiate receptors in the brain responsible for mood. my doctor has always been on the cutting edge of current research and was extremely open-minded in trying this med with me - and to welcomed relief as well! i have had almost all good results from this medication. it has definitely aided in the treatment of my very-treatment-resistent depression. the following are the benefits that i have noticed from taking subutex:     1. quick-acting - because subutex is sublingual (dissolves under your tongue) it gets into your system immediately and does not have to be processed by your digestive system first.     2. gentle effects - i have definitely not experienced any ""highs"". just a subtle, but noticeable improvement in a feeling of wellbeing.     3. also helps somewhat with anxiety by having a calming effect; in normal doses this happens without any tiredness.     4. have not noticed any of the side effects that i have found with other psychiatric medications such as weight gain/loss, personality changes, sexual effects, etc. also, in case anyone is worried that subutex is a ""partial-opiate agonist"", i must emphasize that this med does not build a tolerance or make you want/need to increase dosage. i have been on this dose for four years without ever even thinking about needing more. however!!! you must understand that - as is the case with all psychiatric medications - you cannot simply stop taking this medication without tapering your dose first or you will experience withdrawal effects. the one saving grace about subutex, though, is that it has a very long half-life and will remain in your system long enough to prevent any type of withdrawal even if you miss a day or two of medication."

4	marginally effective	i originally began this treatment for acne and im still in the process of my acne treatments. however, after a little over two weeks of treatment and seeing an improvement in my skin, i went in for a pap smear and found out that i have asymptomatic chlamydia. i was prescribed 1 gram of azithromycin and while doing my research found out that the exact same dosage i've been taking of doxycycline for 1-2 weeks is considered an effective way of treating chlamydia, but clearly that did not work for me.

9	highly effective	got rid of migraine pretty quickly, in about half an hour, but was not as good as imitrex, the brand name. imitrex would get rid of the migraine more quickly and more completely.   there would be times, perhaps one out of three, where i would  consider taking two of the 50 mg sumatriptans

1	ineffective	absolutely no benefits, did not seem to get better even in a week.  through research i learned that penicillin does not treat a virus and that a virus must run its course.  no idea why my doctor prescribed penicillin.  would rather he had been on the up and up about it instead of prescribing a worthless treatment.

1	ineffective	no improvement at all in symptoms.

2	moderately effective	"i initially switched over from since my insurance covers more of the imitrex prescription.  imitrex just isnt right for me.  i experienced almost all of the side effects such as flushing, sensations of tingling/prickling, weakness, drowsiness, dizziness, and fast/pounding heartbeat.  on top of that the packaging is just horrible!  it comes 9 to a package.  the packaging is a tri-fold ""booklet"" that is very rigid and has individual blisters for each tablet.  it's about 6 1/2 by 3 1/2 inches, folded.  i  like to have migraine meds on me at all times so i ended up cutting the tablets out of the booklet so they would fit in my wallet or purse.  definitely going back to axert!"
8	considerably effective	i took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. it did work considerably in the beginning, however i would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. i would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. it did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably higher dosages then prescribed. in retrospect, i have taken the medication because i was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because i have an addictive personality. i discussed this with my dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. i later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. also, i've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. i think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. i don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. if you have an addictive personality like myself, i think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. but exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, i think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. i suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. i only say this because i know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are very unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. also, alprazolam isnt effective for very long. it is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. i will also say gladly, that i have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. the bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on  , the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. best of luck.

1	marginally effective	there was a minimum amount of pain reduction.  i believe the medication works neurologically and you do not realize you still have pain.  the side effects were so severe i was afraid to drive the car.  my memory and thought process was deeply disturbed and i still felt pain. my thought process changed so quickly during a mid sentence i sounded as if i was on drugs.  the side effects were just not worth tolerating for the small benefit.  i could not help but think with the way this is making me feel mentally what is the effect it is really having on me.  this medication was meant for diabetics that suffer nerve pain.  i feel sorry for someone who would need to remain on this medication if it was helping reduce the pain.  as all medications it is not going to correct the underlying problem just address the symptoms associated with the problem.  i would not recommend anyone take it.

5	moderately effective	we aren't sure.  we wonder if it is really controlling the seizures at all.  we are hoping our daughter can get testing to determine if her seizures are in nature.  she was on with complete control, but was switched to due to her upcoming marriage (much lower risk of birth defects and ability to use birth control pills while on it).  she was completely weaned off of at one point and went almost 8 weeks with no seizure activity.  she also went 5-1/2 months with no seizure activity with before having a tonic clonic seizure.  due to her history of seizures (started at the age of 14 a couple of months after she started her period), and the ability to go for long periods of time without problems, we wonder if she is having extreme spikes in estrogen when she from time to time. we hope that our neurologist will work with an endocrinologist and gynecologist to see if there is some validity to our theory.  the goal is to get her back under complete control.

9	highly effective	seroquel knocks you out, but for me it takes about 2 hours to start working. i take it about 2.5 hours before i actually want to get to sleep, and it lulls me into a very deep sleep. i rarely remember dreams. seroquel has an amazing ability to erase memories of the day before, which for me is usually a good thing. highly recommended for people with severe insomnia and/or rapid mood swings.
8	considerably effective	primarily, my son was much better able to focus, control his impulsivity and, as a result, did better in school.  our house became a much more peaceful place once he was better able to control his temper, which largely came from his frustration in knowing he was not doing as well as he could.

10	highly effective	marked reduction in redness & flushing and complete elimination of pustules.  ease of use over creams, etc.
6	marginally effective	the treatment benefits were marginal at best.  mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that ssris are only effective in the most severe of cases.
9	highly effective	my acne has completely diminished ..i have the occasional break-out, but on a an everyday consistent basis i am now acne-free due to retin-a!  it helps to take a break while using it because your skin will become used to it, however after a few weeks off, the effects are just as wonderful to your skin as when you first began.
10	highly effective	i landed in a west african hospital with my insides coming out and suffering from the worst stomach pain as a result of (probably) eating bad food. i vomited for 12 hours until i got the drip and then i was okay for the next couple days in the hospital (although the stomach pains remained).cipro is also the god of beating urinary tract infections: i've taken both a 3 and 5 day course, and its been effective instantly.
3	ineffective	i did not experience any benefits after one week of usage.  i chose to discontinue the treatment.
10	highly effective	treatment cleared the complexion from acne breakout and eliminated the redness/residual under the skin.  this drug had an almost immediate effect on the facial and back areas of the patient.  if the patient stopped taking the minocycline, the acne almost immediately returned.  it kept the bacteria at bay while on the medication.
3	marginally effective	lunesta helped me sleep the first few times i took them and gave me 5-6 hours of sleep without waking up every hour (like i normally do without taking it).

2	marginally effective	the bone mass in my spine improved.   one hip was stable and one had lower bone density
10	highly effective	the benefits are helping to control my cystic acne. i used to have very painful acne cysts that caused major scarring on my cheeks and chin. i did use accutane for about 4 months to clear it up. however, i still breakout. not with cysts but smaller pimples. they seem to form in a cluster in certain areas. i have tried all kinds of topical as well as oral medication to keep these breakouts at bay. spironolactone has pretty much helped reduce the breakouts to almost non existant. my face is also less oily.

9	highly effective	my blood sugar is under control. i went from an a1c of over 8.0 to an a1c of 5.3 over the course of treatment. this medication has had minimal side effects and i developed a tolerance to the side effects in a short period of time- about 30 days. this medication is easy to take and doesnt dissolve on your tongue thus avoiding a bitter pill taste. in its generic form this medication is quite affordable.
5	marginally effective	to be honest, i am uncertain yet. i believe it will take months to see results
7	moderately effective	tsh went up to 51 when put on low dose of natural thyroid. doing better on synthroid rather than generic brand.  still have fatigue, memory, weight loss problems.  i believe there are things that the blood tests do not show. not freezing anymore.

10	highly effective	my hair loss that i was experiencing stopped completely in it's tracks, and i actually grew back some hair at the crown of my head.  every individual to whom i've recommended the drug has had at least their hair loss stop.  im a complete cynic and consider this a wonder drug. once you start taking it (and if you continue to take it for the rest of your life- hey, that's science, man) you will keep all the hair you have from that moment on.
1	ineffective	there were not any benefits.  changed and the new formula didnt agree with my skin.

10	highly effective	better mood, loss of appetite,weight reduction. lost  in 2 months.
5	marginally effective	fingers didnt turn white for as long or as often as they used to.  however, my fingers are still a shade of blue, and hands are still cold.  my face still changes colors throughout the day, from pale, to blue, to red.  it helped, but not enough.  the doctor has prescribed nifedipine to see if that works better.
7	moderately effective	since my hypothyroidism is being better treated i rarely get a migraine anymore. i get one every couple of months or so. i have to say that i sort of dread taking the imitrex because i do experience several side effects, but it usually gets rid of the headache so it winds up being a catch 22. i really hate the muscle aches and weird tight feeling in my head and face. the increase in heart rate can freak me out too, especially if my thyroid meds have just been bumped up too.
10	highly effective	complete improvement in flat sad affect.  felt depression completely lift by the end of four weeks.

10	highly effective	this ia a life altering medication for me.  i get occasional migraines due to hormonal changes, allergy and weather changes.  this medication stops a severe headache and it rarely returns.  it works within about an hour.  it stops a migraine that may last for two days at times.  i am not a big fan of taking medications but this one is a miracle drug.
8	considerably effective	"within 3 weeks i noticed a ""lifting "" of mood and a general sense of being more energized and interested in everyday activities. i was far less concerned about things which had previously worried me and felt more enabled to engage in social activities again."
6	moderately effective	the benefits of taking this drug were a slow down in mpb (male pattern baldness). i noticed that less hairs in the m shape were falling out. it also some of the hair that was lost for several years ago in the crown area. i also noticed that thin, weak hairs stronger and thicker.
9	considerably effective	both seem to work well but looking for something over the counter that helps sleeping so i dont have to take the prescription med. to sleep. it is too expensive. it also would  take a hour or so for it to work. then if i woke up later i had to take another one to go back to sleep. so i am trying to find a good over the counter sleep medicine to take instead.
7	considerably effective	some control of partial seizures- they decreased from 3-4/wk to 1-2/mo
3	highly effective	eliminated severe pain post surgery

8	highly effective	the benefits were numerous, i don't have panic attacks for the first time in 20 yrs, and if i do, they are less than 20 seconds.  i haven't had a mixed state or very rapid cycling since getting on it 2 years ago.  these symptoms continued to get more severe until i got on this drug.  every episode was worse and lasted longer.  this drug gave me my life back.  i lost my job(s) and wound up in psychiatric inpatient care.  but i have become steadily better since first taking the drug.  i have to admit, to get to the point im at now took 2 years, but it's better then i was, and it's better than not getting better at all.  the longer im on seroquel, the better i feel.  also, i am able to sleep because of seroquel.  at the worst when i went into the hospital i couldnt sleep at all which was making my episode even worse.  sleeping drugs and benzodiazepines such as valium that were given to me made me feel horrible, very tired the next day, and even made me panic.  anticonvulsants and even other psychotics gave me panic attacks, made me antsy or made me so tired i couldnt even function in day to day life.  seroquel doesnt make me real tired, but it  has made a sleep schedule possible again.  i also don't feel too tired in the morning.
5	moderately effective	it did lower my bp some
8	considerably effective	after a few weeks my skin started to clear up and look my younger and clearer.  i did experience some tightening in my skin and dryness.  also, i was instructed not to apply any moisturizer to my t-zone since that is my problem ares.
8	considerably effective	if i have a classical migraine, i cannot function without taking an imitrex. imitrex takes the edge off the pain, takes away the feeling of nausea and i am able to work on the computer, which i otherwise could not do with a migraine. the pills work most of the time but do not work if the headache was not a migraine. the drug used to have an effect quicker on me several years ago when it took care of my migraine within 30 minutes. today it often takes me an hour to feel better after taking imitrex.

1	ineffective	no benefits whatsoever, no change in bone density. i took one tablet on the same day each week with plenty of water first thing in the morning and stood upright for the next two hours as i prepared for work. the side effects were numerous and severe, and with continued use compounded themselves to the point that i feared i may not survive the year. my physician at the time refused to believe me and insisted that i continue taking the drug. i began intense research on my own and discovered i was not alone, and would have to make every attempt to save myself.
10	highly effective	full long lasting erection up to two days after dosage,plus it works when you are ready, i must say it brings you back to your youth.
2	ineffective	helped me easily get a good sleep. possible reduction in ibs symptoms.
8	considerably effective	slowed the hair loss and thickened the hair somewhat...pretty good i thought !
5	marginally effective	i didnt notice dramatic results with this product and it was fairly expensive at $100 for one tube. i wasn't religious about applying it each day, so that might have had an impact on the effectiveness. i didnt notice significant fading of the darkest large freckles on my face as i had hoped. i didnt notice any significant reduction in wrinkles.
2	ineffective	after the administration of the first injection the pain decreased, however after a period of two weeks it returned. a second injection was administered. there was no improvement and undesirable side effects, as described below, appeared.
2	considerably effective	after taking the zyban for 3 weeks my desire to smoke was nearly eliminated. i had tried other methods to quit smoking and this one actually worked! unfortunately i had a severe allergic reactions to the medication (the main ingredient wellbutrin).
10	highly effective	early this year i started noticing my skin around the eye beginning to lose its firmness: wrinkles formed during sleep could not be smoothed out by using lancome eye cream.  though, applying a collagen eye product does tighten up the eyelids, but only on the surface, and causing the skin around the eye to crack following facial motions.  i was very self conscious about the wrinkles. after using renova (i've been using it for about two month now), the wrinkles are smoothed, and where the skin easily wrinkles is firmed up, supple and elastic.
3	considerably effective	reduced blood pressure and stopped cholesterol from forming in my arteries.
5	moderately effective	i have a long history in taking anti-depressant drugs.  it started in high school with prozac and desipramine, neither of which i have anything positive to report.  in college, after a dangerous stint without treatment, it resumed with luvox, and  later it was effexor.  finally, after the scariest bout of all, leading to a stay in the hospital, they put me on wellbutrin.  combined with rigorous therapy, dbt (dialectical behavioral therapy) groups, and much personal work, i got my head above water.  i was able to work, eat well and exercise regularly, but many of the symptoms were still there.  i thought that was the extent of what an anti-depressant could do for me, the rest of the work was up to me and maybe in about 20 years i might be able to feel happiness.  since then i went off wellbutrin during a cross-country move, was part of a study for treatment resistant depression where it was recommended i try cymbalta.  i feel the cymbalta has actually influenced my negative thinking and given me more energy.  so now i know that an anti-depressant can potentially create better results than just keeping ones head above water.
8	highly effective	decreased er visits due to control of the migraine at onset.  lower stress level with the migraine due to medications quick action.
1	ineffective	none.
1	ineffective	none
1	moderately effective	not worth the cost of the side effects.  becasue i was so miserable, i discontinued the medication early and opted for a more conventional anti-biotic.
10	highly effective	i stayed loose and limber throughout the day.  didnt end up limping at the end of the day or after a 30 min car ride.  it made me feel like i was in my 30's again instead of my 50's.  it enables me to do yoga moves which i could not do because of the pain.  it's changed my life.  none of the side effects that narcotic pain relievers give.  no tiredness or spaciness
1	ineffective	none, the sinus condition remained after a short trial of the levaquin.  i had to resort to a regular z-pak.

9	highly effective	calmed anxiety - was having 4-6 anxiety attacks daily. helped to stabilize my mood.slept at least 7 hours - initially was started on sleeping pills. would wake up around 5 times a night. with the seroquel i only wake up a couple times a night.
7	considerably effective	taking the medicine was only once a day at the time i chose to take it. it helped me most during stressed situations of any size. i could handle anything and not get angry.
5	moderately effective	it exfoliated my skin.
10	highly effective	my experience with zyprexa has been very positive. it really saved my life.i am able to think very clearly now.
10	highly effective	most say it takes 6 weeks for this drug to really be in your system. after taking for 3 days i could feel the effects, i was much calmer and able to handle stressful situations, and back to myself. my problem was that small daily stresses tended to become much larger than they should have. i am now much more able to let small things roll off my back.
7	highly effective	reduction of oral prednisone and prednisone eyedrops w/ eventual stoppage. uveitis cleared. inflammatory arthritis is ongoing. i am undergoing new treatment with mtx currently.
7	considerably effective	i do feel much more awake, but i still need a nap everyday even after taking both of my doses. with 8-10 hours of sleep im still very fatigued, but i am able to think more clearly...and even drive again. my mood is much better and seems to be more stable than before. the endless fatigue used to spin me out of control and send me into rage, and the only way that i could deal with the rage was to clean like mad crazy and put my focus on anything other than the real issues...all the while never eating or drinking anything for weeks at a time. from there i would become extremely manic and focus only on organization, my eating disorder and cleaning. this hasn't happened at all since taking in combination with cymbalta. i did read that this medication is not recommended for people with a history of mania, ocd or eating disorders....but i feel that it's been very effective in the long run for me.
9	highly effective	my hair had been falling out, and it finally stopped after taking this for a while.  now it is growing back and getting thicker.  before i was always cold and my hands would even get numb from being so cold all the time.  now i am finally warm and don't have to wear a sweater  in the summer.
9	highly effective	completely eliminated neck pain. interestingly, did not reduce slight-to-moderate left hip pain (see article on pain in 11/09 issue of scientific american)
9	highly effective	i don't have to worry about forgetting to take a pill or a condom breaking.  i have had no vaginal dryness,my sex drive is still the same (high), no cramping, matter of fact, i was cramping very badly the day that i started the ring and within an hour of insertion, my cramps went away.  i actually had blood clots before i started the ring, and now my periods are so much more lighter so i am not clotting at all. :)  also, my period duration has been cut in half from 5-7 days to 3 or 3.5 days.  i think it's awesome!!  my partner does not feel it at all and we have it enthusiastically (vigorously)!
5	marginally effective	cleared head and sinsus

9	highly effective	the pain in my back and neck caused stress and spasms. the medication relived the pain , nearly completely  and allowed the spasms to subside. i tried anti inflammatory before for this re occuring problem and found them to be nearly useless. strong pain killers like and are affective but do not allow me to maintain any normal activity during the drug use.
3	moderately effective	apparently prevented wound infection, though efficacy of drug is questionable and causality cannot be established.
10	highly effective	nocturnal myoclonus (similar to restless leg syndrome) causes severe jerking of the legs every 15 seconds for up to 7 hours. lisinopril allowed both myself and my partner to sleep at night. somehow, the drug works without the adverse effects the other sleeping pills, neuro transmitter pills and anti-depressants had.
8	considerably effective	singulair appeared to help somewhat with being able to breathe better.rhinitis was decreased.  it helped me miss fewer work days, especially when air index quality was poor.
1	marginally effective	the medicine did help with the pain.
10	considerably effective	i have increased energy while taking this medication. it has possibly prevented osteoporosis. my family is quite prone to this, and my bone density tests only show slight osteopenia.

8	considerably effective	increased interest and enthusiasm in activities.
6	considerably effective	since using the retin-a along with the accutane, i have noticed a great improvement in the look of my skin.  there are less clogged pores and it definitely more smooth and even in skin tone.  any fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead have diminished but it hasn't helped much with fine lines around my eyes.
7	considerably effective	i noticed at first with the a boost in energy, and more regular sleeping habits. at the upgrade shortly into month two i went from smoking a pack a day (25 cigarettes) to about 3. my boyfriend smokes also which is why i still have a few a day. also after smoking pot it's nice to have a smoke i find.
2	highly effective	sleep
10	considerably effective	addition of neurontin reduced overall pain severity at the neuropathic injury site (r cervical spine), and appeared to lessen a qualitatively different component of the pain to that helped by tramadol. combination of tramadol and neurontin in carefully tested combination (to suit patient) brought best pain result to date (injury prior).
9	highly effective	for the first time in years i woke up without widespread flu like pain throughout my body. i woke up feeling rested, awake, alert. some days were still worse than others, but overall a dramatic difference. i could function throughout the day, wasn't almost falling asleep all the time. if work got crazy and i had to pull 14-16 hrs - which was quite frequent - i didnt get immediately sick.  i actually flew on planes multiple times without getting sick. i used to blink and get sick because my system was so run down despite many hours of sleep a night. when i take xyrem i need only 6-8 hours of sleep and i would wake up and feel great throughout the day. it was an absolute lifesaver for me.
3	moderately effective	reduction of asthma symptoms and severity, less shortness of breath and light headedness

4	marginally effective	slight initial improvement of viral aggravated asthma.
5	highly effective	helped me sleep well
2	ineffective	absolutely none
8	considerably effective	first of all there are a ton of competitors like rogaine on these reviews bashing propecia, how can you only take it for 3 months and have side effects that have ruined your life, i find that highly unlikely. second, propecia does work even for a receding hairline, if u think your going to regrow your childhood hairline 99% of the time you wont  i have managed to keep my hair and regrow the thin parts and it just feels a lot better. and of course if you take a hormone blocking drug your gonna have sides but they are not bad at all i can still get a boner in about 10 seconds and its not limp. it didnt start really regrowing until about 6-7 months in so u gotta give it time.
10	highly effective	improved range of motion, pain relief and decreased soreness
7	moderately effective	when i apply this cream on the infected area, it sometimes relives the pain in few seconds, or few mins. it is a symptomatic temporary relief. but the allergy repeats itself few months later.
9	highly effective	i was taking for muscle inflammation in my ribs caused by sever coughing from bronchitis.  it helped with the pain a lot and helped me sleep through the night.
10	highly effective	the treatments stopped my monthly acne breakouts.  this allowed my skin to heal and broke the breakout cycle.  my skin has not wrinkled as fast as my friends of the same age.
8	considerably effective	compared with synthroid that was prescribed to me in the beginning, i have fewer problems, like mood swings, sweating, weight gain, etc.
2	ineffective	none

1	ineffective	amoxicillin did little, if any, good for the infection i had with my abscessed tooth. i also had a skin lesion caused by a bacteria, per the doctor, but amoxicillin did not effect this at all. it stayed the same through the days i took this antibiotic.
8	considerably effective	able to move easier, not in as much pain, more energy, sleeping better, mood is stable.
1	considerably effective	infection cleared up in a week
4	moderately effective	took for insomnia for about 3 weeks. did not notice a difference. the doctor prescribed  and still no difference. finally, i was prescribed and have been taking that dosage for about 2 months.i do sleep a little better than before, but i still do not sleep through the whole night.
7	considerably effective	acne significantly reduced or disappeared, but returns immediately upon stopping treatment.
1	ineffective	the treatment benefits were very minimal because of the severe rage that i experienced. i don't think i benefited at all from taking this drug.
7	considerably effective	i feel better about myself and less anxious and depressed.
8	highly effective	the benefit was a lowering of blood sugar and metformin does that very well without leading to hypoglycemia which can happen with some of the other anti drugs.

10	highly effective	"the prescription recommended that i use the gel every night, but this became too drying on my skin.  i alternate one night of retin-a, 1 night of stri   the retin-a causes my face to peel, so exfoliating frequently is necessary so that i don't look as if my face has dandruff.  i use a for cleansing; it has been wonderful.  i have also used benefit's ""bluff dust"" to cover the redness that the retin-a gel causes, and continue to use for my rosacea.  the retin-a is very effective, but also quite expensive.  i have found a pharmacy in canada where i can order it online for less than 50% the us price.  i hope this doesnt make me sound unpatriotic!  i have always taken good care of my skin, and have no big wrinkles or droops --except for those lines between my eyebrows, because i am a committed   i do not believe that retin-a would be as effective on skin that has already developed a good deal of sagging, but this is my personal opinion and is based only on my own experience."

9	highly effective	i have tried various alternatives to penicillin and this has been the best. i had a nasty cat bite (a tooth stuck in my bone, so it was deep). i was told i was highly likely to get a a deep and painful infection given the depth of the bite. so i was warned to take all of these or i'd be back later for iv treatment and it would be a far longer course. well, i took 8 of the 10 days prescribed and not only did i never get an infection, i had few side effects. there was, perhaps, a slight stomach upset but not even enough to need what i use -- yogurt. i'd recommend this to those who need a penicillin replacement.

10	highly effective	this anti-depressant has basically saved my life.  i have suffered with severe depression and anxiety since childhood.  whether these problems were caused by 'nature or nurture' can be difficult to ascertain, but in my particular case, i believe it was both.  while i was a victim of severe sexual, physical and verbal abuse from a very young age through my teen years, i also seem to have been born with an unusually 'sensitive' disposition, and can get very emotionally and mentally disturbed at times with very little provocation.  everyone who knows me well considers me a very emotional person.  at any rate, it has been the prozac that has helped me in dealing with the stresses of even everyday life.  i first started feeling suicidal in adolescence, and unfortunately, this is still a constant problem.  the prozac, i am convinced, has helped me keep these feelings in check, and although i was just hospitalized for my depression late last year, i am still alive and kicking.  i completely believe that it is the prozac that has saved my life.  before the advent of these types of antidepressants, all that was available were the tricyclics.  those never worked for me the way the ssri's have.  although they did achieve in putting me into a stupor-like condition, they never seemed to alleviate my depression.  the prozac does.  while it doesnt rid me of the problem completely, it has been absolutely invaluable to me, and i believe it is the main reason i am alive to write these words to you today.  i am fortunate in that i have never had a single side effect from the prozac.  actually, there has been a complete loss of libido, which could be a major problem for alot of people;  for me, however, this is not a problem, because i am celibate, and have been for 20 years.  trust me, i had enough sex in my younger years to last me for the rest of my life.  i feel i should mention that i have known many people who take prozac and who have not had any sexual problems at all.

10	highly effective	i have been plagued with persistent multiple warts on my elbow for over 10 years. at christmas - i decided to 'attack' the area again to clear it for the summer. i used the freezing technique, but warts were clearly trying to spread outside the treated area onto fresh skin areas..  i then added the salicylic acid to the new growths but this just made my arm/skin sore.  i could see the only solution was to control the virus itself to prevent any new spread as the thickened areas died off with the cryotherapy. i used a thin smear of acyclovir around the treated areas and all the new wart 'blistering' stoped irritating within an hour or so and died back.  if i left the cream off - they would start again.  i persisted with the cream daily for 2 weeks and for the first time in 10 years or more my arm is 'wart free' and i have healthy unbroken wart free skin.

10	highly effective	of all of the birth control pills i've taken this was by far the one with the least number of negative side effects and it actually had several positive side effects.  it helped control my acne and kept me thin.  after several years i did notice a decrease in my libido which came back after i stopped taking birth control pills altogether.  i was put on the generic version of this pill at some point and i had a completely different reaction.  i instantly gained about 15 pounds (mostly water weight i think because i looked puffy).  i found out after this reaction that generic pills don't have to be identical to the brand name drugs.  i learned the hard way.

7	highly effective	having had asthma since i was a child, i have been using various medications for a long time. thankfully i do not need to use albuterol daily, as i know some people do, but i use it as needed when i am experiencing an asthma attach. this happens on average once a month, less in warmer months, more during the winder.as far as being effective albuterol, and the name brand inhaler is the best, and to my knowledge, still the only small inhaler that really works. im sure it has saved lives. with one inhalation i am able to breath again within minutes, this is even if i am having a bad attack, and am really struggling  so it is very effective

7	considerably effective	acid reflux stopped, i am told that the damage done by the acid will be healed.  but i am not sure if this drug really strengthens the sphincter such that acid reflux is stopped.  nexium mainly reduces acid production, but does is stop the efflux is yet to be seen based on the results after stopping the treatment.
10	highly effective	no diarrhea and better drug efficacy.

7	highly effective	it truly cleared my headache in three days. i felt no reason to finish the meds unless it was necessary. that pretty much sums it up as to say i would recommend it to others in need. i thank the drug and pharmaceutical industry much indeed. again, thank you.
9	highly effective	immediate benefits were realized, faster than my doctor anticipated. also, i wouldn't always take lexapro consistently, and when symptoms returned, by resuming lexapro, i experienced results in 2-3 days.
9	highly effective	"i've taken various anti-depressants through the years, but this was the closest i ever came to a ""cure"". granted, it was after i stopped taking the medication that this ""cure"" took place, but i never experienced this with other anti-depressants. while taking it, effexor made me so sleepy all the time that i slept a good deal more than normal (10-12 hours daily). this is why i stopped taking it. but when i did, i felt better than i had in years. i remained depression-free for about 3 years. i then dealt with depression again for about 8-10 months (i didnt want to lose another 6-8 weeks taking the effexor ""cure"" so i delayed, hoping i would just ""snap out of it"" on my own). when i finally conceded this wasn't going to happen, i returned to my doctor, who then convinced me to try something new, so i tried cymbalta, hoping to get effexor's benefits, without the side-effects. it worked well as long as i used it, but when i stopped, there was no ""cure"" like i'd had with effexor. now i take 600-1000 mg of same. it's not as good as the post-effexor experience, but i feel less dependant on the medical system for my maintenance, and i focus on physical health (good food, exercise, vitamins)to maintain my emotional health. those things alone, unfortunately, do not completely do it for me, and that's where the same comes in. it makes the difference."

10	considerably effective	i had hit the wall dealing with work, clients and family. my general physician asked me to see a therapist to help get me going in the right direction. after one meeting it was recommended by both caregivers that i take something to help me get through this rough spot. after about 3 weeks i started feeling like things were easier to cope with and i was making good decisions and getting things done again.

6	moderately effective	this drug works great for water retention because it is a potassium-sparing diuretic.  however, it had only a moderate impact on acne. it did seem to help with premenstrual symptoms and cyclical acne, but not a complete cure by any means. no apparent impact on blackheads/hard plugs.
10	highly effective	lowered hba1c from 6.0 to 5.2 which has enabled me to go off numerous other anti diabetic medications which all had side effects.  the overall effect has been most agreeable including a loss of over 100 pounds of body fat.

10	highly effective	before the use of tablets, i had to endure a series of urinary infections after sometimes painful sexual intercourse.  i also had painful cracks in lining of vulva due to aging and dryness.  after beginning the use of this drug, i found that the increased mucous in vagina resolved both of these problems.

10	highly effective	i would sell my soul to the devil to obtain this miracle pill.  in a little as 30 minutes the intense pain and nausea are gone after one zomig.  i have had migraines since in my early teens where i was unable to function for as long as 48 hrs.  i have lost jobs, missed family outings and missed many opportunties due to migraine,  zomig changed all of that and allowed me to take the medication and go to work and all the outings that i had missed.  i had a young family when i discovered zomig and it was like a miracle was handed to me.

8	considerably effective	i was hospitalized in january for suicidal thoughts/attempts. at the time, i had been diagnosed with clinical depression and prescribed antidepressants only. they would induce mania and i was totally out of control, so much so that i pretty much lost all of my friends and went through a divorce. at the hospital, i was diagnosed as bipolar and since taking with effexor, i've had no thoughts of suicide or cutting, which i used to do often.
2	ineffective	essentially there were no identifiable treatment benefits.

8	considerably effective	good cognitive enhancer.  i like that the effects come on very subtly and they also go away in the same manner.  i don't like to feel like i need a prescription which has no other (yet) proven benefits in long term cognition, i hope to either find another supplement to do something similar or see some research which shows provigil has many more benefits than it does drawbacks.

2	highly effective	the medication was effective at preventing pregnancy

9	considerably effective	clobex was effective in resolving minor contact dermatitis. it soothed the irritation and lessened the dermatitis rather quickly however, it was also used for what was thought as dermatitis around the mouth. use continued for six months with no results. the rash was exacerbated by heat and a diagnosis of mrsa was made. the  due to steroids in the cream, did not clear the lesions but rather made them worse. use was discontinued and and ds was highly effective at clearing the infection. have since had no need for and have used alternate methods for any incidental dermatitis that may occur. for those who chose to traditional medications, i can recommend for mild to severe dermatitis. i was satisfied with the results, except for the misdiagnosis of skin mrsa, yet glad to know from experience, the difference between these two rashes.

8	highly effective	the medication works very well in conjunction with the gluconate to help calm the extra heart beats.  i started on the medication when i was 19 and am still on it today at age 50.  i've tried other new drugs but always seem to come back to this tried and true one.
6	moderately effective	i felt calmer and my overall outlook was better. it was subtle...still had some nerve problems and anxiety, but my guess is thats because it does not erase problems...but you can tolerate them better over the long haul.
7	considerably effective	prevented pregnancy, acne was lighter, predictable periods
8	highly effective	there was a huge reduction in the number of migraine headaches that i experienced.  before i started on the meds, i was getting migraines 3-4 times per week.  now i get them once or twice a year.  i think the daily meds may even slightly reduce the rate at which a migraine (the rare times that i get them now) comes on.

5	considerably effective	for awhile it did prevent cold sores. then i started having frequent chest pains as well as fainting spells. now im finding out from an er physician and the pharmacist i 1. should never have been prescribed this dosage (twice what should be prescribed in per day) and no-one should take acyclovir for this length of time either. i've been told this is the reason for my fainting spells, chest pain, low blood pressure problems, increased kidney (renal) damage, yeast infections and most recently a series of fungal infections.

6	highly effective	keeps me alive during flare-ups!  (they incl pericarditis & pleural effusions, ie inflammation of the lining around the heart and lungs involving lots of fluid for which there isnt space, leading to heart failure and breathlessness - nice...) i can more or less live a normal life, apart from at the start of a flare (and spending hours researching online!).

8	considerably effective	it was a very strong pain killer.
8	considerably effective	"lexapro immediately reduced my propensity for negative thoughts (e.g., " im not worthy"" / ""everything sucks""). it was almost as if thinking negatively became impossible. consequently, panic attacks and depression diminished greatly.the drug also made me feel overall less tired (i was previously feeling tired all the time). consequently, my sleeping pattern normalized."

9	highly effective	the benefits were remarkable and fast.  before taking the  the patient got very little sleep and consequently was irritable.  after taking the  the restless legs calmed down immediately.  the patient can now go to a movie, take a trip in a car and sleep with a reasonable amount of comfort.  the restless legs are not totally cured, but it is manageable now.  even working 8 hours a day is much more manageable.

3	marginally effective	there was an improvement in the healing time for acne
8	highly effective	effective in helping to control acid reflux
8	highly effective	storage of a drug may not seem important, but betaseron does not have to be refrigerated  which makes it highly portable.  but the main benefit is that the lesions that i was originally diagnosed with did not worsen over time.  in addition,  i have had no new lesions since beginning betaseron.  so this has helped to slow the progress (secondary progressive relapse/remit) and i believe decreased the amount of relapses with residual.  which, if you have ms this is what you aim for.
3	marginally effective	very little benefit, slept a bit better, still got anxiety, cant always sleep, offered valium as well for bad days, good days are wonderful, stressful time isnt over yet so body still goes into panic
10	highly effective	bmi was 36 before i started meridia.  after 4  bmi is 28.  lost 43 pounds.  increased energy and confidence.  another benefit was an increase in alertness and confidence.  i had low blood pressure and was quite passive before, and with the medication felt an increase in energy and heart rate.  my behaviour changed - i became more assertive because i was more impatient than before.
10	highly effective	i took tamiflu as soon as i knew i had contracted swine flu.  while it did not stop the flu in its tracks i did not get seriously ill and my recovery time was quite short.  somo of my friends also contracted swine flu and did not take tamiflu.  two of them became very ill and it was several weeks before they could go back to work.  their general energy levels were low for about 2 months.  by contrast, i was never really bed bound and was out and about after about one week.  i did not experience any longer term effects.

1	ineffective	none. when i was last encountering depression 10 years ago, my doctor gave me some round green pills whose name i can't remember  they worked well, helping numb my depression as i sorted out my life. after recent suicidal feelings regarding a reactive depression to losing my job, my gp prescribed me citalopram. i just wanted something to numb me again as things got better(which they did) but these tablets nearly sent me crazy.

7	moderately effective	generally, lamictal has helped my depression (intense sadness, hopelessness) more than my anxiety (obsessions, excessive worrying). the mood difference is noticeable. my psychiatrist prescribed lamictal to me because, as a mood stabilizer, lamictal is often used to treat resistant depression. considering that i had previously taken seven different medications in failed attempts to treat depression, this was an appropriate choice.
1	ineffective	none, i was very disappointed at the time because the doctor said that it going to take care of my problem. i had no energy.
10	considerably effective	my heart burn was relieved within forty eight hours and continued for the length of the treatment.  i was very satisfied with the results.
7	considerably effective	happier, slept better. the lexapro helped with energy levels and anxiety; the with sleep. together they worked quite well, i thought, as i was peppier during the day and slept well at night. so all in all, i would say that this was an excellent combination for someone suffering from sleep deprivation, which contributed to depression, low energy, and anxiety. i felt cured

10	highly effective	i didnt have any symptoms, so i don't feel any better or any worse after being on crestor. my cholesterol has always been high during routine blood tests but around a year ago it had risen to 8 mmol/l (almost 300 ml/dl)and my hdl/ldl ratio was poor. were normal before taking crestor after weight loss.

5	moderately effective	general gradual lowering of cholesterol levels over a period of twelve months
1	marginally effective	i never got pimples, pustules, or anything else associated with this condition.  but maybe i never would have--it is hard to say.the first dermatologist to prescribe it wanted to put me on several weeks of antibiotics.  i really did not want the systemic side effects of that.  also, i oppose the overuse of antibiotics because it leads to resistant bacteria.  so one benefit is that it gave him an alternative to antibiotics.
1	ineffective	none whatsoever as i was only on it for 6 months . i had no health problems prior to taking this drug to help my bone density, it created havoc with my previous good health.
4	marginally effective	fosamax tended to hold the line, i.e., my bone density did not progress rapidly.it never increased the density.  the density decreased gradually.
8	considerably effective	the wellbutrin and effexor alone did improve the depression but the addition of the lamictal really made a significant improvement.  with just the two antidepressants i could still feel down and unmotivated, lethargic, hopeless at times.  but the lamictal prevented me from going down.  i have been diagnosed with dysthymia among other things and i have been told that there might be some sort of cycling akin to what manic-depressives have but of course not to that extreme.  the doctor was concerned initially about my diagnosis - the thought was that the diagnosis i had received  dysthymia  may have been wrong and really i was a manic-depressive (which i am not).  apparently this is a mistake that can be made quite a bit.  this is what i thought was implied.  boy have i been glad that someone came up with

3	marginally effective	i experienced some alleviation to the constipation but it was not ongoing.  it was temporary & it was not regular.  i expected that the treatment would be a cure not jsu a temporary relief.
8	considerably effective	increased confidence, more frequent sex, renewed intimacy with partner.
10	highly effective	i suffer with tension and headaches caused by stress. headaches and tension in my back and shoulders, i find that nurofen is the only drug that will subside them releasing the tension and pain. nurofen permits me to continue with my work or daily activities.

10	highly effective	i have seen a great improvement since taking zoloft.  i am a classic type a person and tend toward anxiety when i have alot going on in my personal and professional life.  i asked my physician about zoloft when my second child was 2 years old and i was under alot of stress at work.  i sleep much better, am more even tempered, and more optimistic when taking zoloft.  another benefit, probably due to my anxiety being under control, is that i think more clearly.  i don't become distracted as easily and find it easier to stay focused on projects at work.

7	considerably effective	kept the high blood pressure normal. of course patient has also changed lifestyle - exercising four times a week, eating light sodium and low calorie foods. diet of vegetables and fish or white chicken, fruits and grains, no red meats. we believe it is both lifestyle and medication that have lowered the high blood pressure.
10	highly effective	acute pain in tooth subsided normally within 30 minutes, and the relief lasted 6-8 hours.  allowed me to sleep the entire night without being awakened by the return of pain.i was later prescribed codeine after the procedure, which only dulled the pain to half intensity.

10	highly effective	the stuff works like a charm--fast and effective.
1	moderately effective	none
7	considerably effective	panic attacks and depression completely alleviated; true 'happy pills'. i wish i could keep on taking them indefinitely as i am in a life situation which can't be readily changed in the foreseeable future, where i am unhappy and stressed, which can and does lead to depression and negative, sometimes suicidal, thoughts. i found sertraline completely ineffective for my ibs.

6	marginally effective	not sure if it is effective or not.  pain is gone in the morning but steadily increases as the day progresses.  i am virtually unable to function by evening.  i think i may ask my physician to prescribe an additional to be taken in the afternoon to see if that prevents the pain rebound in the afternoon.
10	highly effective	almost immediate (i.e. within 15 minutes) relieve of severe nerve and/or muscle pain in neck, shoulder &/or lower back. these patches work like a miracle for me, although others who have used them say they offered no relief for muscle or nerve or shingles pain.  i have bone spurs in my neck which sometimes irritate the nerves in my neck and cause excruciating pain ... also periodic sciatica and shoulder and upper & lower pack pain from an auto accident.  chiropractic and message helps, but these patches are used when those interventions fail to bring about sufficient relief ... especially for the nerve pain in my neck. i use them only as a last resort.
7	considerably effective	overall acid reduction; however, it could be sporadic.  with taking the medication, still had to watch diet and avoid triggering foods.  at times, the medication was not effective.
9	highly effective	i went from being in extreme pain and sometimes almost immobile to being able to go back to work at a physical job
10	highly effective	i was taking this drug as birth control, and it has been extremely effective.  (no children, yet!) the fact that you only need to take it four times a year is great, so it is difficult to miss a dose. (unlike the pill, which you take everyday, and missing it even once alters it's effectiveness.)  as an added bonus, i no longer have my period, which were extremely painful and disrupted my life for a whole week every month.  i no longer suffer from pms symptoms, either.  i can not complain about this drug at all.
9	considerably effective	significantly helped in reducing congestion and headaches. incidence of illness and or secondary sinus infections were reduced.

1	ineffective	there were no benefits that i could perceive.  the hair loss continued but worst of all the side-effects from this drug are severe and permanent.  this is very disturbing!
8	highly effective	i never really had any complications with my disease. it seemed to help treat the ulcers in my colon. it also let me be able to eat normal foods because when a person has ulcerative colitis they have to monitor what they eat and usually have to eat bland foods. it really helped me a lot but the side effects took away from the overall rating. the side effects most likely worsened because i was on the drug for a long period of time.
4	moderately effective	less anxiety, emotional stability
9	considerably effective	this worked better than an estrogen patch.  i felt better and virginal atrophy was almost cleared up.
8	highly effective	when the drug wears off pain starts to increase to an almost intolerable level after taking 1 dose the pain is swept away and left feeling almost 100% better. but i must take 2nd dose in 12 hrs, to keep pain at bay.
3	marginally effective	i'm told it opens airways, but also hear there are neg side effects. without it, im a bi more wheezy  but not much.
8	considerably effective	dramatic increase in eyelash growth and thickness, eyelashes became noticably longer after four weeks, with good growth experienced at the 12 week (3 month mark).
7	moderately effective	the resulting small, fluid-filled blisters (vesicles) most commonly occur on the palms and fingers of your hands and on the soles and toes of your feet. the blisters usually last for three to four weeks.the blisters often cause intense itching. scratching the blisters can damage the skin and, in some cases, lead to infection. once the blisters dry, they often leave cracks and painful grooves (fissures) in your skin.risk occurs twice as often in women as in men. other risk factors include:    * stress, because appears to be more common during times of stress    * exposure to metal salts, such as chromium, cobalt and nickel usually through cement or mechanical work    * having seasonal allergies, such as hay fever    * frequently exposing your skin to water or other wet substances

8	considerably effective	"venlafaxine is a bicyclic antidepressant, and is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor  , but it has been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. it works by blocking the transporter ""reuptake"" proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. the neurotransmitters affected are serotonin (5  and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). additionally, in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, with recent evidence showing that the norepinephrine transporter also transports some dopamine as well, implying that snris may also increase dopamine transmission. this is because snris work by inhibiting reuptake, i.e. preventing the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters from taking their respective neurotransmitters back to their storage vesicles for later use. if the norepinephrine transporter normally recycles some dopamine too, then snris will also enhance dopaminergic transmission. therefore, the antidepressant effects associated with increasing norepinephrine levels may also be partly or largely due to the concurrent increase in dopamine (particularly in the prefrontal cortex)."
10	highly effective	"i have had svt's all my life.  it was only when i turned 24 that i sought treatment for them as they usually were linked with a syncope episode.  i was originally put on the grandfather of beta/alpha blockers inderal.  while this drug was effective at treating my migraines, it was not particularly effective at controlling my palpitations and it tended to lower my blood pressure too much.  i always felt tired and had little energy on this drug.  at 24 years of age i was not happy to have the energy of a 65 year-old.  next came atenolol and (when i was pregnant).  i also had break-through palpitations with these drugs as well as low energy side effects.  with i could barely jog down my street without becoming significantly winded and according to my cardiologist i fell into the 94th percentile for ""in-shape"" people my age.  finally, when hit the market i was thrilled.  first of all i didnt need a large dose of it to be effective.  second, it was effective.  i experience no break-through palpitations, and last but not least there were very few to no side effects.  i had energy again and i could get throught my cardiovascular exercise without becoming winded."

8	considerably effective	"cymbalta got me out of a major depression.  i am still taking it.  it also relieved my back pain for about 6 months but that good effect has diminished.  while i still am not the happiest camper, i am able to function normally.  i was not able to function before the cymbalta.  when i first got on it, i had extreme fatigue for several days and some ""electric jolts""  when i was lying down.  however, that side-effect has gone.  it also causes some constipation, which is something i've rarely experienced!  i eat a very high-fiber diet but even so im not my ""normal"" regular self.   im writing this because of all the negative things i've read online.  if i had read them before i started the cymbalta i would not have gone it.  im happy i did not read anything!  i now feel that these reviews are written by  people with miserable results, or people who are incredibly impatient and expect and instantaneous cure are the folks writing most reviews."

5	considerably effective	so far, i have experienced an uplift in mood and a dulling of anxious reactions and pms symptoms.  i can't say it's all due to the prozac, as im employing cbt methods, but my anxiety has not escalated into a full blown attack and i generally feel a lot better about life and about myself.  im still weighing if these benefits are worth all of the symptoms im experiencing.  it's been hard to maintain a positive outlook when i don't feel normal due to the trembling and

2	ineffective	there were little to no benefits to using differing to treat acne.  while it may have helped exfoliation, it did little to treat current and to prevent future acne.  instead of differing  using a separate skin exfoliation product in addition to an over the counter acne treatment might have been more beneficial.  my acne worsened using differing -- some say it is because the impurities are being purged from beneath the outer layers of the skin.  i don't know if i completely buy this theory though i would have believed it if it showed some improvement after three months.  unfortunately, it did not.
8	considerably effective	pristiq elevated mood and energy levels.

10	highly effective	the idea is to take one pill each day for three days and then up the dose to twice per day.  at day 10 the patient is to stop smoking altogether.  i did this and found that in fact by day 8 or 9 i felt an eversion to smoking.  niggling cravings every few days trickled to a craving once a week or so which is weak and easily overcome. the prescription is typically for 3 months but i didnt need any refills at all.  i stopped taking the drug after a month or so.i recommend this drug only under the care of a physician to anyone interested in stopping smoking once and for all.  certainly a person must be commited to the decision to quit smoking though or save your money.
9	highly effective	the major benefit of taking this medication was a decrease in the signs and symptoms of anxiety that i experience when in social situations. it prevents the elevation in heart rate that i normally get, as well as preventing dry mouth, sweaty palms, etc. as a result, i am much more able to focus on the task at hand.

8	considerably effective	i took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. it did work considerably in the beginning, however i would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. i would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. it did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably higher dosages then prescribed. in retrospect, i have taken the medication because i was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because i have an addictive personality. i discussed this with my dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. i later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. also, i've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. i think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. i don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. if you have an addictive personality like myself, i think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. but exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, i think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. i suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. i only say this because i know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are very unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. also, alprazolam isnt effective for very long. it is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. i will also say gladly, that i have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. the bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on  , the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. best of luck.
7	considerably effective	helped with acne and cysts even though not used daily as prescribed. face was overall clearer over time. the best part was helping with pimples that formed into cysts.
7	moderately effective	the doctor told me that this medication would suppress my appetite as well as increasing my metabolic rate which would assist in weight loss.  as i only had to lose 10kg i am not sure that i was the best candidate.
10	highly effective	i was told to avoid coffee, tea, chocolate & peppermint :'(  my hiatal hernia is tiny, but i feel fortunate that i was told about it before it got out of hand.  i feel 100% better 90% of the time, and when i don't, it's usually because i forgot to take my pill the previous day.  i would prefer for my pain to be treated by diet changes alone, but it's nice to have a pill to rely on.  it's my goal to control my pain naturally, wish me luck!

9	considerably effective	wellbutrin has been very effective for my low-grade depression. i have tried many other antidepressants in the past and have found them to be ineffective and/or causing too many side effects (weight gain, sexual side effects, fatigue, etc.). wellbutrin actually helps me maintain my weight and has minimal sexual side effects.

5	considerably effective	most often the diazepam got me to sleep fairly quickly but did not last the whole night through.  the liquid capsules were then superceded by tablets which usually took about twice as long to kick in.  ie, 40 mins instead of 20. the benefit was there if i was unable to sleep otherwise but a benzo sleep is not natural and feels different to real sleep.

10	highly effective	citalopram turned me into myself again. i didnt really have depression but suffered from too much worrying and anxiety to carry on healthy relationships and feel in control of my life. i have just begun feeling the full effects of this medication and it is incredible. i wake up early in the morning, rested and ready to go. i feel more motivated, have more energy and feel much more focused. i have also experienced some weight loss while on citalopram, probably because i feel so motivated and energetic to actually exercise! additionally i've noticed my worrying, anxiety and emotional eating have decreased significantly.

9	highly effective	i had developed panic attacks and depression. i had other symptoms such as small weight gain, hair thinning, very tired and slept allot.  the doctor originally thought that i simply had depression so she prescribed an anit-depressant.  after about a year things still were not right.  so she did a thyroid panel.  she quicky got me on a regular dosage and the panic and depression went away along with most of the other symptoms.

9	considerably effective	after 15 years of ineffective medications, i finally got my rosacea under control with  i still have occasional flare-ups, but with nowhere near the intensity or frequency i had them before. i wish i had discovered this medication years earlier. i see a lot of people here saying they abandoned after a few days because it initially made their rosacea worse. i had the same experience, but pushed through, and found that it worked wonders by the 2nd or 3rd week. you just have to deal with looking awful for a week or two. like i said, it's not perfect, but it really has made life a lot better for me. i just hope it remains effective until they find a cure (ha!).

10	highly effective	singulair is very effective in keeping my asthmatic symptoms in control.  if i forget to take it, i can tell that my breathing becomes more labored by about 36 hours after the last dose.  i will on occasion (maybe 1-2 times per week) need to use my rescue inhaler (albuterol), but it is primarily needed to ease discomfort and not to stop a full blown asthma attack.  in fact, i have not suffered a full blown asthma attack since i started taking singulair.

10	highly effective	not only was my nose cleared up almost immediately, my allergies as harsh.  my step father is a md and he prescribes this to all of his patients.  i love this stuff.  the only bad part was that for the first minute or so after spraying it everything smelled very bad.
